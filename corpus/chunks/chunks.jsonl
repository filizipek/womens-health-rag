The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days.\nWhen your period is at its heaviest, the blood will be red. On lighter days, it may be pink or brown.\nYou'll lose about 20 to 90ml (about 1 to 5 tablespoons) of blood during your period, although some women bleed more heavily than this.\nRead more about\nheavy periods\nperiod pain\nirregular periods\nand\nstopped or missed periods\nWhen do periods start?\nPeriods usually begin at around the age of 12, although some girls will start them earlier or later.\nA delay in\nstarting periods\nisn't usually a cause for concern. Most girls will be having regular periods by age 16 to 18.\nRead more about\nearly or delayed puberty\nPeriod products\nPeriod products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of period products are:\npads\ntampons\nmenstrual cups\nPads\nPads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood.\nPads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is.\nYou can also get reusable washable pads.\nPantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of pad that can be used on days when your period is very light.\nTampons\nTampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body.\nThere are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it.\nTampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly.\nIt is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood.\nMenstrual cups\nMenstrual cups are an alternative to pads and tampons.

In PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place.\nIt's difficult to know exactly how many women have PCOS, but it's thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.\nMore than half of these women do not have any symptoms.\nSymptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nIf you have\nsigns and symptoms of PCOS\n, they'll usually become apparent during your late teens or early 20s.\nThey can include:\nirregular periods or\nno periods at all\ndifficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or no ovulation\nexcessive hair growth (hirsutism)\n– usually on the face, chest, back or buttocks\nweight gain\nthinning hair and\nhair loss\nfrom the head\noily skin or\nacne\nPCOS is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as\ntype 2 diabetes\nand\nhigh cholesterol\nlevels.\nWhat causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\nThe exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families.\nIt's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin.\nInsulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body.\nMany women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this.\nThis contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone.\nBeing overweight or\nobese\nalso increases the amount of insulin your body produces.\nTreating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nThere's no cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to a GP if you think you may have the condition.\nIf you have PCOS and you're overweight,\nlosing weight\nand eating a\nhealthy, balanced diet\ncan make some symptoms better.\nMedicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems.\nIf fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended.\nThis involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone.\nWith treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.\nPage last reviewed: 11 October 2022\nNext review due: 11 October 2025", "n_chars": 3123, "n_tokens_est": 780, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.848403Z"}

Sometimes the changes taking place can cause irritation or discomfort, and sometimes you may be concerned.\nThere's rarely any need for alarm, but you should mention anything that's worrying you to your maternity team.\nConstipation in pregnancy\nThe hormonal changes in your body may cause you to become constipated very early on in your pregnancy.\nTo help prevent constipation, you can:\neat foods that are high in fibre, such as wholemeal breads and cereals, fruit and vegetables, and pulses such as beans and lentils – read more about\nhaving a healthy diet in pregnancy\nexercise regularly to keep your muscles toned – read more about\nexercise in pregnancy\ndrink plenty of water\navoid iron supplements, which can make you constipated – ask your doctor if you can either manage without them or change to a different type\nYou can read more about\nconstipation\n, including symptoms and treatment.\nCramp in pregnancy\nCramp is a sudden, sharp pain, usually in your calf muscles or feet. It's most common at night.\nRegular gentle exercise in pregnancy, particularly ankle and leg movements, will improve your circulation and may help prevent cramp. Try these foot exercises:\nbend and stretch your foot vigorously up and down 30 times\nrotate your foot 8 times one way and 8 times the other way\nrepeat with the other foot\nIt may help to ease cramp if you pull your toes hard up towards your ankle or rub the muscle hard.\nFeeling faint in pregnancy\nYou may feel faint while pregnant. This is usually due to hormonal changes.\nFainting\nhappens if your brain is not getting enough blood and, therefore, not enough oxygen.\nYou are most likely to feel faint if you stand up too quickly from a chair or out of a bath, but it can also happen when you are lying on your back.\nHere are some tips to help avoid feeling faint:\ntry to get up slowly after sitting or lying down\nif you feel faint when standing still, find a seat quickly and the faintness should pass – if it does not, lie down on your side\nif you feel faint while lying on your back, turn onto your side\nIt's better not to lie flat on your back in later pregnancy or during labour. You should avoid going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks as it has been linked to a higher risk of stillbirth.\nFeeling hot in pregnancy\nYou're likely to feel warmer than usual during pregnancy. This is due to hormonal changes and an increase in blood supply to the skin. You're also likely to sweat more.\nIt can help if you:\nwear loose clothing made of natural fibres, as these are more absorbent and breathable than synthetic fibres\nkeep your room cool – you could use an electric fan\nwash frequently to help you feel fresh\nIncontinence in pregnancy\nIncontinence\nis a common problem during and after pregnancy. You might be unable to prevent a sudden spurt of pee when you cough, laugh, sneeze, move suddenly or just get up from a sitting position.\nThis may be temporary, because the pelvic floor muscles (the muscles around the bladder) relax slightly to prepare for the baby's delivery. There are\nexercises\nyou can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.\nIf you have a problem, talk to your midwife, doctor or health visitor.\nPeeing a lot in pregnancy\nNeeding to pee a lot often starts in early pregnancy and sometimes continues until the baby is born. In later pregnancy, it's caused by the baby's head pressing on your bladder.\nIf you find you need to get up in the night to pee, try cutting out drinks in the late evening. However, make sure you drink plenty of non-alcoholic, caffeine-free drinks during the day to stay hydrated.\nLater in pregnancy, you may find it helps to rock backwards and forwards while you’re on the toilet.

This type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due.\nCervical changes\nPregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and this may sometimes cause bleeding – after sex, for example.\nMiscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\nDuring the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of\nmiscarriage\nor\nectopic pregnancy\nIf you bleed at this stage of pregnancy and the pregnancy ends, there is no reason for you not to go on to have a successful pregnancy.\nTreating bleeding in early pregnancy\nYou may be offered a medicine called progesterone to stop bleeding in early pregnancy. This will only be recommended if you've had a scan to confirm you're pregnant and you've had a miscarriage before.\nYour doctor may recommend you take the medicine twice a day until you're 16 weeks pregnant.\nMiscarriage\nIf a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it's called a miscarriage. Around 1 in 5 pregnancies ends this way.\nMany early miscarriages (before 13 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. There can also be other causes of miscarriage, such as hormone or blood clotting problems.\nMost miscarriages occur during the first 12 weeks (3 months) of pregnancy and, sadly, most cannot be prevented. Other symptoms of miscarriage include:\ncramping and pain in your lower abdomen\na discharge or fluid from your vagina\na discharge of tissue from your vagina\nno longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick\nIf you have bleeding or any of these symptoms, contact your midwife or GP straightaway.\nEctopic pregnancy\nAn\nectopic pregnancy\nis when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb – for example, in the fallopian tube.\nIt can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg cannot develop properly outside the womb. The egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines.\nSymptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy but can happen later.\nOther signs of ectopic pregnancy can include:\ntummy pain low down which may be on one side\nvaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge\npain in the tip of your shoulder\ndiscomfort when peeing or pooing\nCall 111 if you have symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy.\nCauses of bleeding in later pregnancy\nCervical changes\nThese can lead to bleeding, particularly after sex.\nVaginal infections\nYour midwife or doctor can discuss tests and treatment with you.\nA 'show'\nThis is when the plug of mucus that has been in the cervix during pregnancy comes away, signalling that the cervix is getting ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself.\nFind out about the\nsigns of labour\nand\nwhat happens in labour and birth\nPlacental abruption\nThis is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the womb wall. Placental abruption usually causes stomach pain, and this may occur even if there is no bleeding.\nLow-lying placenta (placenta praevia)\nThis is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the womb, near to or covering the cervix.

But it usually clears up by weeks 16 to 20 of your pregnancy and does not put your baby at any increased risk.\nThere is a chance of developing a severe form of pregnancy sickness called\nhyperemesis gravidarum\n. This can be serious, and there's a chance you may not get enough fluids in your body (\ndehydration\n) or not get enough nutrients from your diet (\nmalnutrition\n). You may need specialist treatment, sometimes in hospital.\nSometimes\nurinary tract infections (UTIs)\ncan also cause nausea and vomiting. A UTI usually affects the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys.\nNon-urgent advice:\nCall your midwife, GP or 111 if:\nyou're vomiting and:\nhave very dark-coloured urine or have not had a pee in more than 8 hours\nare unable to keep food or fluids down for 24 hours\nfeel very weak, dizzy or faint when standing up\nhave tummy (abdominal) pain\nhave a high temperature\nvomit blood\nhave lost weight\nTreatments for morning sickness\nUnfortunately, there's no hard and fast treatment that will work for everyone’s morning sickness. Every pregnancy will be different.\nBut there are some changes you can make to your diet and daily life to try to ease the symptoms.\nIf these do not work for you or you're having more severe symptoms, your doctor or midwife might recommend medicine.\nThings you can try yourself\nIf your morning sickness is not too bad, your GP or midwife will initially recommend you try some lifestyle changes:\nget plenty of rest (tiredness can make nausea worse)\navoid foods or smells that make you feel sick\neat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit in the morning\neat small, frequent meals of plain foods that are high in carbohydrate and low in fat (such as bread, rice, crackers and pasta)\neat cold foods rather than hot ones if the smell of hot meals makes you feel sick\ndrink plenty of fluids, such as water (sipping them little and often may help prevent vomiting)\neat foods or drinks containing ginger – there's some evidence ginger may help reduce nausea and vomiting (check with your pharmacist before taking ginger supplements during pregnancy)\ntry acupressure – there's some evidence that putting pressure on your wrist, using a special band or bracelet on your forearm or by pressing with your fingers, may help relieve the symptoms\nFind out more about vitamins, supplements and nutrition in pregnancy\nAnti-sickness medicine\nIf your nausea and vomiting is severe and does not improve after trying lifestyle changes, your GP may recommend a short-term course of an anti-sickness medicine, called an antiemetic, that's safe to use in pregnancy.\nOften this will be a type of\nantihistamine\n, which are usually used to treat allergies but also work as medicines to stop sickness (antiemetic).\nAntiemetics will usually be given as tablets for you to swallow.\nBut if you have severe morning sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), your doctor may suggest an injection or a type of medicine that's inserted into your bottom (suppository).\nSee your GP if you'd like to talk about getting anti-sickness medicine.\nRisk factors for morning sickness\nIt's thought hormonal changes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are probably one of the causes of morning sickness.\nBut you may be more at risk of it if:\nyou're having twins or more\nyou had severe sickness and vomiting in a previous pregnancy\nyou tend to get motion sickness (for example, car sick)\nyou have a history of migraine headaches\nmorning sickness runs in the family\nyou used to feel sick when taking contraceptives containing oestrogen\nit's your first pregnancy\nyou're obese (your BMI is 30 or more)\nThe charity Pregnancy Sickness Support", "n_chars": 3973, "n_tokens_est": 993, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.862399Z"}

With increasing numbers of women in the labor force, the effects of work on women's health have recently started to interest health care providers, health and safety representatives and researchers. We begin our summary of their discoveries with a discussion of women's place in the workplace and its implications for occupational health, followed by a brief review of some gender-insensitive data-gathering techniques. We have then chosen to concentrate on the following four areas: methods and data collection; directing attention to women's occupational health problems; musculoskeletal disease; mental and emotional stress. We conclude by pointing out some neglected occupational groups and health issues.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nPublication types\nResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nReview\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nMeSH terms\nData Collection\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nFemale\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nHealth Services Needs and Demand\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nHumans\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nMorbidity\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nOccupational Health*\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nResearch Design\nActions\nSearch in PubMed", "n_chars": 4001, "n_tokens_est": 1000, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.879938Z"}

An ecologically stable vaginal microbiota is dominated by\nLactobacillus\nspecies, which plays an important role in the prevention of genital infections by controlling the vaginal pH, reducing glycogen to lactic acid, and stimulating bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, an abnormal vaginal microbial composition is associated with an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, sexually transmitted diseases, preterm labor and other birth defects. This microbial diversity is affected by race, ethnicity, pregnancy, hormonal changes, sexual activities, hygiene practices and other conditions. In the present review, we discuss the changes in the microbial community of the vaginal region at different stages of a female's life cycle and its influence on her reproductive health and pathological conditions.\nKeywords:\nLactobacillus; bacterial vaginosis; preterm birth; vaginal microbiome.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nPublication types\nReview\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nMeSH terms\nFemale\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nHumans\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nInfant, Newborn\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nLactobacillus\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nMicrobiota*\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH\nAdd to Search\nPregnancy\nActions\nSearch in PubMed\nSearch in MeSH", "n_chars": 3990, "n_tokens_est": 997, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.887808Z"}

However, accuracy of personal breast density knowledge remains unclear. We compared self-reported with clinically assessed breast density and assessed knowledge of density implications and feelings about future screening.\nMethods:\nFrom December 2017 to January 2020, we surveyed women aged 40 to 74 years without prior breast cancer, with a normal screening mammogram in the prior year, and ≥1 recorded breast density measures in four Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registries with density reporting laws.

We measured agreement between self-reported and BI-RADS breast density categorized as \"ever-dense\" if heterogeneously or extremely dense within the past 5 years or \"never-dense\" otherwise, knowledge of dense breast implications, and feelings about future screening.\nResults:\nSurvey participation was 28% (1,528 of 5,408), and 59% (896 of 1,528) of participants had ever-dense breasts. Concordance between self-report versus clinical density was 76% (677 of 896) among women with ever-dense breasts and 14% (89 of 632) among women with never-dense breasts, and 34% (217 of 632) with never-dense breasts reported being told they had dense breasts. Desire for supplemental screening was more frequent among those who reported having dense breasts 29% (256 of 893) or asked to imagine having dense breasts 30% (152 of 513) versus those reporting nondense breasts 15% (15 of 102) (P = .003, P = .002, respectively). Women with never-dense breasts had 6.3-fold higher odds (95% confidence interval:3.39-11.80) of accurate knowledge in states reporting density to all compared to states reporting only to women with dense breasts.\nDiscussion:\nStandardized communications of breast density results to all women may increase density knowledge and are needed to support informed screening decisions.\nKeywords:\nBreast density; breast density notification; patient-reported outcomes; screening mammography.\nCopyright © 2022 American College of Radiology.

During the postpartum period, which is the time\nafter you give birth\n, you may have mood swings, crying spells, or feel anxious. These feelings are common and are often called the postpartum \"baby blues\". The baby blues usually go away within a few days to a week.\nIf your symptoms are more severe and last longer than two weeks, you may have postpartum depression.\nPostpartum depression is a common but serious\nmood disorder\nthat can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth. Without treatment, symptoms may make it hard to care for your baby or manage daily tasks.\nWhat causes postpartum depression?\nThe exact cause is unknown, but postpartum depression likely results from a combination of factors, including:\nSudden changes in hormone levels after pregnancy\nPhysical changes\n, such as dropping\nthyroid hormone levels\nLifestyle factors, such as fatigue, lack of sleep, limited support, or recent stressful events\nWho is at risk for postpartum depression?\nAnyone can develop postpartum depression after childbirth. You might be at higher risk if you:\nHave a history of\ndepression\nbipolar disorder\n, or a family health history of these conditions\nHad a\nmultiple birth\n(twins, triplets, or more)\nGave birth while in your teens\nHad\nhealth problems during pregnancy\nHad\npreterm labor\nor other complications during childbirth\nHave a baby with special needs\nHave ever experienced\ndomestic violence\nAre dealing with financial stress\nHad an unplanned pregnancy\nWhat are the symptoms of postpartum depression?\nPostpartum depression symptoms are more intense and last longer than the baby blues.\nSymptoms may include:\nFeeling sad or empty most of the time\nEating too much or too little\nSleeping too much or too little\nCrying more than usual or for no clear reason\nFeeling unusually angry\nPulling away from family and friends\nFeeling worried or anxious often\nFeeling little or no interest in your baby\nConstant doubts about your ability to care for your baby\nThinking of harming yourself or your baby\nIf you have thoughts about\nsuicide\n, or hurting yourself or your baby\nget help right away:\nCall 911 or go to your local emergency room\nContact a crisis hotline.

Others are emergency cesarean deliveries, which are done when\nunexpected problems\nhappen during delivery.\nWhen is a cesarean delivery needed?\nYou may need a cesarean delivery because:\nYou have\nhealth problems\n, including\ninfection\nYou are carrying\nmore than one baby\nYour baby is too big\nYour baby is in the wrong position\nYour baby's health is in danger\nLabor is not moving along as it should\nThere are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby)\nNot everyone who has had a cesarean delivery before will need another one next time. You may be able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Talk to your health care provider about what is right for you.\nHow is a cesarean delivery done?\nBefore the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get:\nAn epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine.\nA spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid.\nGeneral anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency cesarean deliveries.\nDuring the surgery, the surgeon will:\nMake a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical.\nOpen the amniotic sac and take out your baby.\nCut the umbilical cord and the placenta.\nClose the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve.\nWhat are the risks of a cesarean delivery?\nA cesarean delivery is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include:\nInfection\nBlood loss\nBlood clots\nin the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs\nInjury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder\nreaction\nto the medicines or anesthesia used\nSome of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a cesarean delivery than from a vaginal birth. And having a cesarean delivery can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. The more cesarean deliveries you have, the more the risk goes up.\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nStart Here\nCesarean Sections (C-Sections)\n(Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in\nSpanish\nDelivery by Cesarean Section\n(American Academy of Pediatrics)\nAlso in\nSpanish\nHaving a C-Section\n(March of Dimes Foundation)\nLabor and Delivery, Postpartum Care (Cesarean Delivery)\n(Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nAlso in\nSpanish\nWhat Is a C-Section?\n(Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development)\nRelated Issues\nBreastfeeding after Cesarean Delivery\n(American Academy of Pediatrics)\nAlso in\nSpanish\nRepeat C-Sections: Is There a Limit?\n(Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nAlso in\nSpanish\nVBAC: Know the Pros and Cons\n(Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)", "n_chars": 3968, "n_tokens_est": 992, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.911361Z"}

You have reached menopause when you have not had a period for 12 months.\nThe time leading up to menopause is called the menopausal transition, or perimenopause. This transition usually begins in when you are in your 40s, but sometimes it can start earlier. It can last for several years. The most common age for reaching menopause is between 45 and 55 years old.\nWhat is early menopause?\nEarly, or premature menopause happens when your ovaries stop making hormones and periods stop before age 40. This can happen on its own (with no known cause). It can also happen because of surgery to remove the ovaries or\nuterus\n. Medical treatments such as\nchemotherapy\nor hormone therapy to treat\nbreast cancer\nmay also cause early menopause.\nA condition called\nprimary ovarian insufficiency\n(POI) happens when your ovaries stop working normally before you are age 40. But this condition is different from early menopause. If you have POI, you may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly. And you might still be able to get pregnant.\nWhat are the symptoms of menopause?\nDuring the menopausal transition, your ovaries start to make less of the estrogen and progesterone hormones. The changes in these hormones cause the symptoms of menopause, which can include:\nA change in your periods; they may be:\nIrregular, with more or less time in between periods.\nShorter or longer.\nLighter or heavier.\nHot flashes, a sudden warm feeling in your face, neck, and chest. They may cause you to\nsweat\n. If they happen at night and cause sweating, they are called night sweats.\nTrouble sleeping\n, such as trouble falling asleep or getting back to sleep when you wake up. Over time, a lack of sleep can lead to\nfatigue\nand\nmemory problems\nVaginal dryness, which may cause pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse.\nMood changes, which can make you feel moody, anxious, or more irritable.\nBladder issues, such as\nurinary incontinence\n(loss of bladder control) and\nurinary tract infections\n(UTIs).\nYou may also have other physical changes which could put you at risk for certain diseases. For example, the loss of estrogen can:\nCause you to lose\nbone density\n. This can lead to\nosteoporosis\n, a condition that causes bones to become weak and\nbreak\neasily.\nRaise your\ncholesterol levels\nand increase your risk of\nheart disease\nand\nstroke\nWhat are the treatments for the symptoms of menopause?\nYou may not need treatment for the symptoms of menopause. But if you do, there are several different types of treatments:\nLifestyle changes\nYou may find that you can manage your symptoms with lifestyle changes. Here are some changes that might make you feel better:\nIf you have hot flashes, dress in layers that can be removed at the start of a hot flash. You may want to carry a portable fan to use when you get a hot flash.\nAvoid\nalcohol\n, spicy foods, and\ncaffeine\n. They can make your menopause symptoms worse.\nIf you smoke, try to\nquit\n, not only for hot flashes, but for your overall health.\nTry to\nmaintain a healthy weight\n.

Being overweight or having\nobesity\ncan make hot flashes worse.\nHave good sleep habits\n. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.\nGet regular exercise\n. It can help you sleep better, improve your mood, and help lower your risk for many age-related diseases.\nLower\nstress\n, for example by using relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and muscle relaxation exercises.\nIf lifestyle changes are not enough to improve your symptoms, you may want to contact your health care provider. They will talk to you about your symptoms, family and medical history, and preferences. They also can explain the risks and benefits of the treatments.\nNon-hormone treatments\nThere are various non-hormone treatments for menopause symptoms, such as:\nMedicines for hot flashes, including certain\nantidepressants\n, a medicine just for hot flashes, an antiseizure medicine, and a\nblood pressure medicine\n. Some of these medicines may also help with sleep problems.\nMedicines for urinary incontinence.\nMedicines to treat or help prevent osteoporosis.\nLow-dose\nbirth control pills\nfor very heavy bleeding or periods that are close together.\nWater-based lubricants to treat vaginal dryness.\nMedicines for painful intercourse that is caused by vaginal changes from menopause.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, for trouble sleeping.\nHormone treatments\nAnother treatment for menopause symptoms is\nmenopausal hormone therapy\n(MHT). It may also be called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This treatment is usually with estrogen or estrogen plus progestin (a type of progesterone that's made in a lab). MHT can be given in pills, skin patches, rings, implants, gels, or creams. It may be used to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness and to help prevent osteoporosis.\nLike all medicines, MHT has benefits and risks. Talk with your provider about whether it is safe for you. If you decide to take MHT, your provider may recommend taking the lowest dose that works for the shortest time needed.\nSupplements, herbs, and \"natural\" hormone creams\nThere are various products that are marketed for menopause symptoms. They include\nsupplements\nherbs\n, and over-the-counter \"natural\" hormone creams. There has been research on many of these products. So far, none of them has clearly been shown to be helpful. Also, there is little information on the long-term safety of these products. Some supplements can have harmful side effects or interact with medicines.

It's also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.\nCoronary artery disease\n(also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease in both men and women. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called\nplaque builds up in the arteries\nthat supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to:\nAngina\n- chest pain from lack of blood flow\nHeart attacks\n- when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow\nHeart failure\n- when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs\nArrhythmia\n- a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\nHow does heart disease affect women?\nIn the United States, heart disease is the number one cause of death in women. But women are often not diagnosed with heart disease as quickly as men are. That's because:\nWomen are more likely than men to have \"silent\" heart disease, meaning that they don't have symptoms.\nHealth care providers may not recognize heart disease in women because women's symptoms may be different from men's symptoms.\nWomen are more likely than men to have certain types of heart disease that can be harder to diagnose.\nA delay in diagnosis may mean a delay in medical care that could help prevent serious problems, such as a heart attack. That's why it's important to learn about your risk for heart disease, the symptoms in women, and how to keep your heart healthy.\nWhat types of heart disease do women get?\nWomen can get any type of heart disease. Like men, the most common type of heart disease among women is coronary artery disease. But there are certain types of heart disease which are less common, but affect women more often than men:\nCoronary microvascular disease\n- Chest pain from spasms (sudden tightening) in the smallest arteries of the heart that pinch off blood flow. It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases. This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests.\nBroken heart syndrome\n- Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It's caused by the\nstress\nof powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you're healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn't cause any lasting damage.\nVariant angina\n- A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries. The pain usually happens in a pattern during sleep. Variant angina rarely causes a heart attack.\nWhich women are more likely to develop heart disease?\nYour risk for developing heart disease increases with:\nMenopause\nWomen can develop heart disease at any age, but your risk increases after your periods stop, usually by age 55. Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female\nhormone", "n_chars": 3848, "n_tokens_est": 962, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.931638Z"}

Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female\nhormone\n) which helps protect against heart disease. That's why women generally develop coronary artery disease 10 years later than men. During and after menopause, estrogen levels drop and your risk for heart diseases goes up. If your periods stop before age 40, your risk will be higher than other women your age.\nFamily history\nof heart disease.\nYour risk for heart disease may be higher if your:\nMother or sister had heart disease before age 65.\nFather or brother had heart disease before age 55.\nProblems during pregnancy\n, such as\nhigh blood pressure\ngestational diabetes\nanemia\n, and\nhigh blood pressure\nUse of hormonal\nbirth control\n(pills, patches, or vaginal rings with estrogen and progesterone).\nEndometriosis\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nInflammatory and\nautoimmune diseases\nMetabolic syndrome\nMental health issues\n, such as stress,\nanxiety\n, or\ndepression\nHealth risks from a lack physical activity\nObesity\nor being overweight.\nDiabetes\nLow\nHDL cholesterol levels\nMild to moderate\nhigh blood pressure\nSmoking\nIf you have one or more risks for heart disease, ask your health care provider for help understanding your risk level. Ask if you need any\nheart tests\nto help catch heart disease early.\nWhat are the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack in women?\nWhen women have symptoms of\nheart disease\n, they may include:\nPain or discomfort in the chest that may be dull and heavy or sharp\nPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly, or back\nNausea or vomiting\nUnusual\nfatigue\nShortness of breath\n(feeling like you can't get enough air) during physical activity\nWomen who have\ncoronary artery disease\nare more likely than men to have chest pain when resting or doing daily activities, rather than during exercise. They're also more likely than men to feel chest pain from mental stress.\nSymptoms of a\nheart attack\nin women may also be different than in men. Chest pain is the most common symptom for both sexes. It may feel like crushing or squeezing. But women are somewhat less likely than men to have chest pain.\nDuring a\nheart attack\n, women may feel:\nPressure or tightness in the chest\nPain in the upper back, arms, neck, jaw or throat\nDizziness\nUnusual fatigue\nIndigestion\nheartburn\n, nausea, or vomiting\nStomach pain\nShortness of breath\nHeart attacks usually don't look like the sudden, dramatic events we see in the movies. The symptoms may be mild or strong. They may start slowly.

Women have one ovary on each side of the uterus (where a fetus grows during pregnancy). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.\nOvaries play a role in\nmenstruation\n, pregnancy, and\nmenopause\n. Your ovaries:\nProduce and store eggs that are released during ovulation (when an egg leaves the ovary and travels into the fallopian tube). If a sperm fertilizes the egg, you can become pregnant.\nMake the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.\nStop making those hormones and releasing eggs during menopause.\nSome medical problems can affect the ovaries. These can cause various symptoms, and some ovarian disorders may need prompt treatment.\nWhat are the types of ovarian disorders?\nSome problems that can happen with the ovaries can include:\nOvarian cancer\nis when a cancerous tumor forms in the tissues of an ovary.\nOvarian cysts\nare fluid-filled sacs in or on an ovary.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS) is a set of symptoms related to an imbalance of hormones.\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency\nis when your ovaries stop working before age 40.\nOvarian torsion is a twisting of the ovary.\nEndometriosis\nis when tissue like the lining in your uterus grows in other places in your body. It may affect the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue lining the pelvis.\nPelvic inflammatory disease\nis an infection and inflammation of the uterus, ovaries, and other female reproductive organs.\nOvarian tumors.\nWhat causes ovarian disorders?\nOvarian disorders can happen for different reasons depending on the condition. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\nWhat are the symptoms of ovarian disorders?\nYour symptoms may be different, depending on the problem with your ovaries. Some ovarian disorders, such as ovarian cysts, may cause few or even no symptoms. Other disorders may cause more severe symptoms. Symptoms can include:\nPelvic pain\n, which often happens during your period\nNausea\nor diarrhea\nVaginal bleeding\nthat is between periods, very heavy, or longer than usual\nVaginal discharge\nPainful menstrual cramps\nHow are ovarian disorders diagnosed?\nTo find out if you have a problem with your ovaries, your health care provider:\nWill ask about your\nmedical history\n, including your symptoms\nWill ask about your\nfamily health history\nWill do a\nphysical exam\n, including a\npelvic exam\nMay order\nimaging tests\n, or\nblood tests\nWhat are the treatments for ovarian disorders?\nTreatment depends on the ovarian disorder, your symptoms, overall health, and plans for pregnancy.

If not treated, a STI can develop into a sexually transmitted disease (STD).\nSTIs are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STIs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact.\nSome STIs can be passed to the fetus during\npregnancy\nor childbirth. Other ways that some STIs may spread include while\nbreastfeeding\n, through\nblood transfusions\n, or by sharing needles.\nThere are more than 20 types of STIs, including:\nChlamydia\nGenital herpes\nGenital warts\nGonorrhea\nHIV\nHPV\nPubic lice\nSyphilis\nTrichomoniasis\nWhat causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nSTIs can be caused by\nbacteria\nviruses\n, and\nparasites\nWho is affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nMost STIs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women. If an STI is passed to a fetus during\npregnancy or childbirth\n, it can cause serious health problems.\nWhat are the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nSTIs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STIs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex.\nIf you do have symptoms, they could include:\nUnusual discharge from the penis or vagina\nSores or warts on the genital area\nPainful or frequent urination (peeing)\nItching and redness in the genital area\nBlisters or sores in or around the mouth\nAbnormal vaginal odor\nAnal itching, soreness, or bleeding\nAbdominal (belly) pain\nFever\nHow are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed?\nIf you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STIs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STIs do not usually cause symptoms.\nSome STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through\nSTI testing\n. Some tests involve a microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STIs.\nWhat are the treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nAntibiotics\ncan treat STIs that are caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STIs caused by viruses, but antiviral medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection.\nIt's important to get treatment if you have an STI. Some types of STIs can cause serious health problems if they are not treated. Talk to your provider about how long to not have sex after treatment to avoid passing the infection back and forth with your partner.\nCan sexually transmitted infections (STIs) be prevented?\nThe surest way to protect yourself against STIs is to not have sex.", "n_chars": 3973, "n_tokens_est": 993, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:36.953664Z"}

Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs.

These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and T richomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended \ntreatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of \nMycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors \nfor syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with \nmen after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health \ncare providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.\nIntroduction\nThe term “sexually transmitted infection” (STI) refers to \na pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact, \nwhereas the term “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) refers \nto a recognizable disease state that has developed from an \ninfection. Physicians and other health care providers have a \ncrucial role in preventing and treating STIs. These guidelines \nare intended to assist with that effort. Although the guidelines \nemphasize treatment, prevention strategies and diagnostic \nrecommendations also are discussed.\nThis report updates Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment \nGuidelines, 2015 (1) and should be regarded as a source of \nclinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards. Health care \nproviders should always consider the clinical circumstances of \neach person in the context of local disease prevalence. These \nguidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves \npersons at risk for STIs, including family planning clinics, \nHIV care clinics, correctional health care settings, private \nphysicians’ offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics \nfor adolescent care, and other primary care facilities. These \nguidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do \nnot address other community services and interventions that \nare essential to STI and HIV prevention efforts.\nThese STI treatment guidelines complement Recommendations \nfor Providing Quality Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical \nServices, 2020 (2) regarding quality clinical services for STIs \nin primary care and STD specialty care settings. This guidance \nspecifies operational determinants of quality services in various \nclinical settings, describes on-site treatment and partner", "n_chars": 4503, "n_tokens_est": 1125, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.767482Z"}

These \nsystematic reviews were focused on four principal outcomes \nof STI therapy for each disease or infection: 1) treatment \nof infection on the basis of microbiologic eradication; \n2) alleviation of signs and symptoms; 3) prevention of sequelae; \nand 4) prevention of transmission, including advantages (e.g., \ncost-effectiveness, single-dose formulations, and directly \nobserved therapy) and disadvantages (e.g., adverse effects) \nof specific regimens. The outcome of the literature reviews \nguided development of background materials, including tables \nof evidence from peer-reviewed publications summarizing \nthe type of study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or case \nseries), study population and setting, treatments or other \ninterventions, outcome measures assessed, reported findings, \nand weaknesses and biases in study design and analysis.\nIn June 2019, the subject matter experts presented their \nassessments of the literature reviews at an in-person meeting \nof governmental and nongovernmental participants. Each \nkey question was discussed and pertinent publications were \nreviewed in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. \nParticipants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their \ninput, and discussed findings in the context of the modified \nrating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(USPSTF). The discussions were informal and not structured \nto reach consensus. CDC staff also reviewed the publications \nfrom other professional organizations, including the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF , \nthe American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society \nfor Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). \nThe discussion culminated in a list of participants’ opinions \non all the key STI topic areas for consideration by CDC. \n(More detailed descriptions of the key questions, search terms, \nsystematic search, evidence tables, and review process are \navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/\ndefault.htm).\nCDC staff then independently reviewed the tables of evidence \nprepared by the subject matter experts, individual comments \nfrom the participants and professional organizations, and existing \nguidelines from other organizations to determine whether \nrevisions to the 2015 STD treatment guidelines were warranted. \nCDC staff ranked evidence as high, medium, and low on the \nbasis of each study’s strengths and weaknesses according to the \nUSPSTF ratings (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.\norg/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings). CDC staff \nthen developed draft recommendations that were peer reviewed \nby public health and clinical experts as defined by the Office of \nManagement and Budget for influential scientific information. \nA public webinar was held to provide an overview of the draft \nrecommendations and invite questions and comments on the \ndraft recommendations.

As part \nof the clinical encounter, health care providers should routinely \nobtain sexual histories from their patients and address risk \nreduction as indicated in this report. Guidance for obtaining \na sexual history is available at the Division of STD Prevention \nresource page (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/resources.\nhtm) and in the curriculum provided by the National Network \nof STD Clinical Prevention T raining Centers (https://www.\nnnptc.org). Effective interviewing and counseling skills, \ncharacterized by respect, compassion, and a nonjudgmental \nattitude toward all patients, are essential to obtaining a \nthorough sexual history and delivering effective prevention \nmessages. Effective techniques for facilitating rapport with \npatients include using open-ended questions (e.g., “T ell me \nabout any new sex partners you’ve had since your last visit” and \n“What has your experience with using condoms been like?”); \nunderstandable, nonjudgmental language (e.g., “What gender \nare your sex partners?” and “Have you ever had a sore or scab \non your penis?”); and normalizing language (e.g., “Some of my \npatients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How \nis it for you?”). The “Five P’s” approach to obtaining a sexual \nhistory is one strategy for eliciting information about the key \nareas of interest (Box 1). In addition, health care professionals \ncan consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such \nquestions as, “Do you have any questions or concerns about \nyour sexual health?” Additional information about gaining \ncultural competency when working with certain populations \n(e.g., gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men \n[MSM]; women who have sex with women [WSW] or with \nwomen and men [WSWM]; or transgender men and women \nor adolescents) is available in sections of these guidelines related \nto these populations.\nIn addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment, a \ncomprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include \nSTI screening as recommended in these guidelines because \nSTIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV \nacquisition and transmission among certain MSM. In most \nclinical settings, STI screening is an essential and underused \ncomponent of an STI and HIV risk assessment. Persons \nseeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be \nscreened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community \nprevalence and individual risk factors (see Chlamydial \nInfections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis). Persons should \nbe informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving and \nnotified about tests for common STIs (e.g., genital herpes, \nBOX 1.

Persons should be informed of their test \nresults and recommendations for future testing. Efforts should \nbe made to ensure that all persons receive STI care regardless \nof personal circumstances (e.g., ability to pay, citizenship \nor immigration status, gender identity, language spoken, or \nspecific sex practices).\nSTI and HIV Infection \nPrevention Counseling\nAfter obtaining a sexual history from their patients, all \nproviders should encourage risk reduction by offering \nprevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective \nif provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner \nappropriate to the patient’s culture, language, sex and gender \nidentity, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. \nPrevention counseling for STIs and HIV should be offered \nto all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have \nreceived an STI diagnosis, have had an STI during the \nprevious year, or have had multiple sex partners. USPSTF \nrecommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually \nactive adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs and \nHIV (4). Such interactive counseling, which can be resource \nintensive, is directed at a person’s risk, the situations in which \nrisk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies. \nOne such approach, known as client-centered STI and HIV \nprevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk \nreduction to the person’s situation. Although one large study in \nSTI clinics (Project RESPECT) demonstrated that this approach \nwas associated with lower acquisition of curable STIs (e.g., \ntrichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) (5), another \nstudy conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different \ncontexts (Project AWARE) did not replicate this result (6).\nWith the challenges that intensive behavioral counseling poses, \nhealth care professionals might find brief prevention messages \nand those delivered through video or in a group session to be \nmore accessible for the client. A review of 11 studies evaluated \nbrief prevention messages delivered by providers and health \ncounselors and reported them to be feasible and to decrease \nsubsequent STIs in STD clinic settings ( 7) and HIV care \nsettings (8). Other approaches use motivational interviewing \nto move clients toward achievable risk-reduction goals. Client-\ncentered counseling and motivational interviewing can be used \neffectively by clinicians and staff trained in these approaches. \nCDC provides additional information on these and other \neffective behavioral interventions at https://www.cdc.gov/\nstd/program/interventions.htm . T raining in client-centered \ncounseling and motivational interviewing is available through \nthe STD National Network of Prevention T raining Centers \n(https://www.nnptc.org).\nIn addition to one-on-one STI and HIV prevention \ncounseling, videos and large group presentations can provide \nexplicit information concerning STIs and reducing disease \ntransmission (e.g., how to use condoms consistently and \ncorrectly and the importance of routine screening). Group-\nbased strategies have been effective in reducing the occurrence \nof STIs among persons at risk, including those attending STD \nclinics (9). Brief, online, electronic-learning modules for young \nMSM have been reported to be effective in reducing incident \nSTIs and offer a convenient client platform for effective \ninterventions ( 10). Because the incidence of certain STIs, \nmost notably syphilis, is higher among persons with HIV \ninfection, use of client-centered STI counseling for persons \nwith HIV continues to be encouraged by public health agencies \nand other health organizations ( https://www.cdc.gov/std/", "n_chars": 4595, "n_tokens_est": 1148, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.767841Z"}

HAV vaccine is \nalso recommended for persons who are homeless (13). Details \nregarding HAV and HBV vaccination, including routine \nchildhood vaccination, are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\nhepatitis and at the ACIP website ( https://www.cdc.gov/\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html).\nCondoms\nExternal Condoms\nWhen used consistently and correctly, external latex \ncondoms, also known as male condoms, are effective in \npreventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection ( http://\nwww.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.\npdf). In heterosexual HIV mixed-status relationships (i.e., those \ninvolving one infected and one uninfected partner) in which \ncondoms were used consistently, HIV-negative partners were \n71%–80% less likely to become infected with HIV , compared \nwith persons in similar relationships in which condoms were \nnot used (14,15). T wo analyses of MSM mixed-status couple \nstudies estimated the protective effect of condom use to be 70% \nand 91%, respectively (16,17). Moreover, studies demonstrate \nthat consistent condom use reduces the risk for other STIs, \nincluding chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis \n(18–21). By limiting lower genital tract infections, condoms \nalso might reduce the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease \n(PID) among women (22). In addition, consistent and correct \nuse of latex condoms reduces the risk for HPV infection \nand HPV-associated diseases, genital herpes, syphilis, and \nchancroid when the infected area or site of potential exposure \nis covered (23–27). Additional information is available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html and \nwww.factsaboutcondoms.com/professional.php . Condoms \nare regulated as medical devices and are subject to random \nsampling and testing by the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA). Each latex condom manufactured in the United States \nis tested electronically for holes before packaging. The rate of \ncondom breakage during sexual intercourse and withdrawal in \nthe United States is approximately two broken condoms per \n100 condoms. Rates of breakage and slippage might be slightly \nhigher during anal intercourse (28,29). The failure of condoms \nto protect against STIs or unintended pregnancy usually results \nfrom inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom breakage \n(30). Users should check the expiration or manufacture date \non the box or individual package. Latex condoms should not \nbe used beyond their expiration date or >5 years after the \nmanufacturing date. Condoms made of materials other than \nlatex are available in the United States and can be classified \ninto two general categories: 1) polyurethane, polyisoprene, or \nother synthetic condoms and 2) natural membrane condoms.\nPolyurethane external condoms provide protection against \nSTIs and HIV and pregnancy comparable to that of latex \ncondoms (20,31). These can be substituted for latex condoms \nby persons with latex sensitivity, are typically more resistant to \ndeterioration, and are compatible with use of both oil-based \nand water-based lubricants.

Although the internal condom also has been used \nduring receptive anal intercourse, efficacy associated with this \npractice remains unknown (33). Additional information about \nthe internal condom is available at http://www.ashasexualhealth.\norg/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf.\nCervical Diaphragms\nIn observational studies, diaphragm use has been \ndemonstrated to protect against cervical gonorrhea, chlamydia, \nand trichomoniasis (34). However, a trial examining the effect \nof a diaphragm plus lubricant on HIV acquisition among \nwomen in Africa reported no additional protective effect when \ncompared with the use of male condoms alone. Likewise, no \ndifference by study arm in the rate of acquisition of chlamydia, \ngonorrhea, or herpes occurred ( 35,36). Diaphragms should \nnot be relied on as the sole source of protection against HIV \nand other STIs.\nMultipurpose Prevention Technologies\nMethods that combine STI and HIV prevention \nwith pregnancy prevention are known as multipurpose \nprevention technologies (MPTs) (37) (https://www.who.int/\nreproductivehealth/topics/linkages/mpts/en ). Internal and \nexternal condoms are both examples of MPTs because they are \neffective prevention measures when used correctly for STI and \nHIV transmission or pregnancy prevention. The multicenter \nEvidence for Contraception Options and HIV Outcomes \n(ECHO) trial observed no statistically significant differences in \nHIV incidence rates among women randomly assigned to one \nof three contraceptive methods (depot medroxyprogesterone \nacetate [DMPA], levonorgestrel implant, and copper-\ncontaining intrauterine device [IUD]); however, rates of HIV \ninfection were high in all groups, indicating a need for MPTs \n(38). Development of MPTs is complex and ongoing; products \nunder study include microbicides with contraceptive devices \n(e.g., tenofovir with a vaginal ring contraceptive delivery \npackage) and other innovative methods (39).\nTopical Microbicides and Spermicides\nNonspecific topical microbicides are ineffective for \npreventing HIV infection ( 40–45). T enofovir gel has been \nstudied for prevention of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) \nand HIV infections (46,47). Adherence can be low (48), and \nprevention of HIV infection, especially among women, has not \nbeen demonstrated (47,49).Vaginal rings containing dapivirine \nhave provided some reduction in HIV infection (50,51). For \nmen and transgender women who have anal intercourse, \ntenofovir gel appears safe when applied before and after anal \nsex (52). Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9) might \ndisrupt genital or rectal epithelium and have been associated \nwith an increased risk for HIV infection. Condoms with N-9 \nare no more effective than condoms without N-9; therefore, \nN-9 alone or in a condom is not recommended for STI and \nHIV prevention (40). N-9 use also has been associated with \nan increased risk for bacterial urinary tract infections among \nwomen (53,54).\nNonbarrier Contraception, Female Surgical \nSterilization, and Hysterectomy\nContraceptive methods that are not mechanical barriers \noffer no protection against HIV or other STIs.

An advance supply of ECPs can be provided or prescribed \nso that ECPs will be available when needed (59).\nMale Circumcision\nMale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV infection and \ncertain STIs among heterosexual men. Three randomized, \ncontrolled trials performed in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, \nwhere generalized HIV epidemics involving predominantly \nheterosexual transmission were occurring, demonstrated that \nmale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV acquisition among \nmen by 50%–60% ( 63–65). In those trials, circumcision \nalso was protective against other STIs, including high-risk \ngenital HPV infection and genital herpes (66–68). Follow-up \nstudies have demonstrated sustained benefit of circumcision \nfor HIV prevention (69) and that the effect is not mediated \nsolely through a reduction in HSV-2 infection or genital ulcer \ndisease (GUD) (70).\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \nrecommend that male circumcision efforts be scaled up as an \neffective intervention for preventing heterosexually acquired HIV \ninfection (71) in countries with hyperendemic and generalized \nHIV epidemics within the context of ensuring universal access \nto comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support \n(https://www.afro.who.int/publications/voluntary-medical-male-\ncircumcision-hiv-prevention). In the United States, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that newborn male \ncircumcision be available to families that desire it because the \nbenefits of the procedure, including prevention of penile cancers, \nurinary tract infections, GUD, and HIV infection, outweigh the \nrisks. ACOG has also endorsed AAP’s policy statement.

Sexually \nactive adults and adolescents should be screened for STIs \n(e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) in accordance with \nrecommendations, and persons with infection should be \noffered PrEP . The USPSTF recommends that persons at risk \nfor HIV acquisition be offered PrEP (84). Persons at risk for \nHIV acquisition include HIV-negative persons whose sexual \npartner or partners have HIV infection (especially if viral load \nis detectable or unknown), persons who have had gonorrhea \nor syphilis during the previous 6 months, and injecting drug \nusers who share injection equipment ( 84). Clinical practice \nguidelines recommend STI screening for persons taking PrEP \n(80) because increased rates of STI acquisition have been \ndescribed (85–87).\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STIs\nProviding HSV treatment to persons with HIV and HSV \ninfection has not demonstrated benefit in reducing HIV \nacquisition among uninfected partners. A large randomized \ncontrolled trial evaluated mixed-status heterosexual couples \namong the partners with HIV infection who also were \nseropositive for HSV-2 ( 88). Use of acyclovir had no effect \non HIV transmission. These findings are consistent with a \nprevious trial that reported no benefit of acyclovir in preventing \nHIV acquisition among persons seropositive for HSV-2 (89).\nDoxycycline prophylaxis has been examined for preventing \nbacterial STIs. In a pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with \nprevious syphilis (two or more episodes since HIV diagnosis) \nwere randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg for 48 weeks \nversus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention (90). \nThat study demonstrated a 73% reduction in any bacterial STI \nat any site, without substantial differences in sexual behavior. \nAdditional studies examining doxycycline prophylaxis are \nunder way or in development (91).\nPostexposure Prophylaxis for HIV and STIs\nGuidelines for using PEP aimed at preventing HIV and other \nSTIs as a result of sexual exposure are available at https://www.\ncdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.\npdf. Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be \nevaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and \ntesting negative for HIV . HIV PEP is also discussed elsewhere \nin this report (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs). Genital \nhygiene methods (e.g., vaginal washing and douching) after \nsexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and \nSTIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), \ncertain STIs, and HIV infection (92).\nSTI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after \nunprotected anal sex has been studied among MSM and \ntransgender women; results demonstrated reduction in incident \nchlamydia and syphilis by 70% and 73%, respectively, but no \neffect on gonorrhea ( 93). Other studies are under way or in \ndevelopment regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial \nSTIs (91). No long-term data are available regarding the impact \nof STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome. \nFurther studies are needed to determine whether STI PEP is \nan effective and beneficial strategy for STI prevention.\nHIV Treatment as Prevention: Antiretroviral \nTreatment of Persons with HIV to Prevent HIV \nAmong Partners\nIn 2011, the randomized controlled trial HPTN 052 \ndemonstrated that, among HIV mixed-status heterosexual \ncouples, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the infected \npartner decreased the risk for transmission to the uninfected \npartner by 96% (94).

Detailed guidance \nregarding ART regimens is available in the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services’ HIV treatment guidelines (98).\nHIV Seroadaptive Strategies\nSeroadaptive strategies for HIV prevention have largely \noriginated within communities of MSM. They are predicated \non knowledge of self and partner HIV status. One specific \nseroadaptive practice is serosorting, which includes limiting \nanal sex without a condom to partners with the same HIV \nstatus as their own or choosing to selectively use condoms \nwith HIV mixed-status partners. Another practice among \nmixed-status couples is seropositioning, in which the \nperson with HIV infection is the receptive partner for anal \nintercourse. Observational studies have consistently reported \nthat serosorting confers greater risk for HIV infection than \nconsistent condom use but has lower risk compared with anal \nintercourse without a condom and without serosorting ( 99–\n101). Serosorting practices have been associated with increased \nrisk for STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea (102,103\n).\nSerosorting is not recommended for the following reasons: \nmany MSM who have HIV infection do not know they \nhave HIV because they have not been tested recently, men’s \nassumptions about the HIV status of their partners might be \nwrong, and some men with HIV infection might not disclose or \nmight misrepresent their HIV status.

For persons who are being treated \nfor an STI (or whose partners are undergoing treatment), \ncounseling that encourages abstinence from sexual intercourse \nuntil completion of the entire course of medication is vital \nfor preventing reinfection. A trial conducted among women \nregarding the effectiveness of counseling messages when \npatients have cervicitis or vaginal discharge demonstrated \nthat women whose sex partners have used condoms might \nbenefit from a hierarchical message that includes condoms \nbut women without such experience might benefit more from \nan abstinence-only message ( 104). A more comprehensive \ndiscussion of abstinence and other sexual practices that can help \npersons reduce their risk for STIs is available in Contraceptive \nT echnology, 21st Edition (31).\nPartner Services\nThe term “partner services” refers to a continuum of clinical \nevaluation, counseling, diagnostic testing, and treatment \ndesigned to increase the number of infected persons brought to \ntreatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks. \nThis continuum includes efforts of health departments, \nmedical providers, and patients themselves. The term “public \nhealth partner services” refers to efforts by public health \ndepartments to identify the sex and needle-sharing partners \nof infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and \ntreatment. Health departments are increasingly incorporating \nreferral to additional services, as indicated, into the partner services \ncontinuum. Aside from the general benefit to patients and partners, \nservice referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that \nincrease risk for future STI and HIV acquisition.\nThe types and comprehensiveness of public health partner \nservices and the specific STIs for which they are offered vary \nby public health agency, their resources, and the geographic \nprevalence of STIs. In most areas of the United States, health \ndepartments routinely attempt to provide partner services to \nall persons with infectious syphilis (primary or secondary) \nand persons with a new diagnosis of HIV infection. Health \ndepartments should provide partner services for persons who \nmight have cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea. In contrast, \nrelatively few U.S. health departments routinely provide \nSTI partner services to persons with gonorrhea, chlamydia, \ntrichomoniasis, or other STIs (105). Because STI diagnoses \noften can serve as risk markers for HIV acquisition (83), public \nhealth services might include follow-up of MSM with an STI \nto offer HIV PrEP . Public health services can also include HIV \nand STI prevention interventions including HIV and STI \ntesting, linkage and relinkage of persons with HIV infection \nto HIV care clinics, and referral of partners of persons with \nSTIs or HIV infection to HIV PrEP , as indicated (106–109). \nClinicians should familiarize themselves with public health \npractices in their area; however, in most instances, providers \nshould understand that responsibility for discussing the \ntreatment of partners of persons with STIs rests with the \ndiagnosing provider and the patient.

Clinicians’ \nefforts to ensure treatment of patients’ sex partners can reduce \nthe risk for reinfection and potentially diminish transmission \nof STIs ( 110). Therefore, clinicians should encourage all \npersons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them \nto seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this \npractice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate \npartner violence ( 111). Available data are limited regarding \nthe rate of intimate partner violence directly attributable \nto partner notification ( 112,113); however, because of the \nreported prevalence of intimate partner violence in the general \npopulation ( 114), providers should consider the potential \nrisk before notifying partners of persons or encouraging \npartner notification. Time spent counseling patients about the \nimportance of notifying partners is associated with improved \nnotification outcomes (115).

Unless prohibited by law or other \nregulations, medical providers should routinely offer EPT \nto patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure \nthat all of a patient’s sex partners from the previous 60 days \nwill seek timely treatment. If the patient has not had sex \nduring the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer \nEPT for the patient’s most recent sex partner. Because EPT \nmust be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment \ninvolves an injection, EPT for gonorrhea should be offered \nto partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage \nis explored. EPT is legal in the majority of states but varies \nby chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Providers should visit \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept to obtain updated information for \ntheir state. Providing patients with packaged oral medication \nis the preferred approach because the efficacy of EPT using \nprescriptions has not been evaluated, obstacles to EPT can exist \nat the pharmacy level (121,122), and many persons (especially \nadolescents) do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by \na sex partner (123,124). Medication or prescriptions provided \nfor EPT should be accompanied by educational materials for \nthe partner, including treatment instructions, warnings about \ntaking medications (e.g., if the partner is pregnant or has an \nallergy to the medication), general health counseling, and a \nstatement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as \nsoon as possible for HIV infection and any symptoms of STIs, \nparticularly PID.\nEvidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical \ntrials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia \nor gonorrhea (125–127). All three trials reported that more \npartners were treated when patients were offered EPT . T wo \nreported statistically significant decreases in the rate of \nreinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or \nrecurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A \nfourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a \ndifference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of \npartners treated between persons offered EPT and those \nadvised to notify their sex partners (128). U.S. trials and a \nmeta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction \nin reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, \ndiffered according to the STI and the sex of the index patient \n(110,125–127).

All pregnant women and their sex partners should be \nasked about STIs, counseled about the possibility of perinatal \ninfections, and provided access to recommended screening and \ntreatment, if needed.\nRecommendations for screening pregnant women for \nSTIs to detect asymptomatic infections are based on disease \nseverity and sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, \nmedicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. \nThe following screening recommendations for pregnant \nwomen summarize clinical guidelines from federal agencies \nand medical professional organizations.\nScreening Recommendations\nHIV Infection\n All pregnant women in the United States should be tested \nfor HIV at the first prenatal visit, even if they have been \npreviously tested ( 138). T esting pregnant women for HIV \nand prompt linkage to care of women with HIV infection are \nvital for women’s health and reducing perinatal transmission of \nHIV through ART and obstetrical interventions. HIV testing \nshould be offered as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests \n(i.e., opt-out testing). For women who decline HIV testing, \nproviders should address their concerns and, when appropriate, \ncontinue to encourage testing. Partners of pregnant patients \nshould be offered HIV testing if their status is unknown (139).\nRetesting in the third trimester (preferably before 36 weeks’ \ngestation) is recommended for women at high risk for \nacquiring HIV infection. Examples of women at high risk \ninclude those who inject drugs, have STIs during pregnancy, \nhave multiple sex partners during pregnancy, have a new \nsex partner during pregnancy, or have partners with HIV \ninfection; those who are receiving care in health care facilities \nin settings with HIV incidence ≥1 per 1,000 women per year; \nthose who are incarcerated; those who live in areas with high \nrates of HIV infection; or those who have signs or symptoms \nof acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, skin \nrash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, oral ulcers, leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia, or transaminase elevation) (140).\nRapid HIV testing should be performed for any woman in labor \nwho has not been tested for HIV during pregnancy or whose HIV \nstatus is unknown, unless she declines.

T o avoid misinterpreting a transient positive \nHBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg \ntesting should be performed before vaccine administration. \nAll laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially \nreactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory \ntest.

Discussions concerning sexual behavior should be tailored \nfor the patient’s developmental level and be aimed at identifying \nrisk behaviors (e.g., multiple partners; oral, anal, or vaginal \nsex; or drug misuse behaviors). Careful, nonjudgmental, and \nthorough counseling is particularly vital for adolescents who \nmight not feel comfortable acknowledging their engagement in \nbehaviors that make them more vulnerable to acquiring STIs.\nScreening Recommendations\nRecommendations for screening adolescents for STIs to \ndetect asymptomatic infections are based on disease severity \nand sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, \nmedicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. \nRoutine laboratory screening for common STIs is indicated \nfor all sexually active adolescents. The following screening \nrecommendations summarize published clinical prevention \nguidelines for sexually active adolescents from federal agencies \nand medical professional organizations.\nChlamydia\nRoutine screening for C. trachomatis infection on an annual \nbasis is recommended for all sexually active females aged \n<25 years (149). Rectal chlamydial testing can be considered \nfor females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and \nexposure, through shared clinical decision-making between the \npatient and the provider ( 170,171). Evidence is insufficient \nto recommend routine screening for C. trachomatis among \nsexually active young males, on the basis of efficacy and cost-\neffectiveness. However, screening of sexually active young males \nshould be considered in clinical settings serving populations \nof young men with a high prevalence of chlamydial infections \n(e.g., adolescent service clinics, correctional facilities, and STD \nclinics). Chlamydia screening, including pharyngeal or rectal \ntesting, should be offered to all YMSM at least annually on \nthe basis of sexual behavior and anatomic site of exposure (see \nMen Who Have Sex with Men).\nGonorrhea\nRoutine screening for N. gonorrhoeae on an annual basis is \nrecommended for all sexually active females aged <25 years \n(149). Extragenital gonorrhea screening (pharyngeal or rectal) \ncan be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual \nbehaviors and exposure, through shared clinical-decision \nbetween the patient and the provider (170,171). Gonococcal \ninfection is more prevalent among certain geographic \nlocations and communities (141). Clinicians should consider \nthe communities they serve and consult local public health \nauthorities for guidance regarding identifying groups that are \nmore vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local \ndisease prevalence. Evidence is insufficient to recommend \nroutine screening, on the basis of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, \nfor N. gonorrhoeae among asymptomatic sexually active young \nmales who have sex with females only. Screening for gonorrhea, \nincluding pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to \nYMSM at least annually (see Men Who Have Sex with Men).\nProviders might consider opt-out chlamydia and gonorrhea \nscreening (i.e., the patient is notified that testing will be \nperformed unless the patient declines, regardless of reported \nsexual activity) for adolescent and young adult females during \nclinical encounters. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that \nopt-out chlamydia screening among adolescent and young \nadult females might substantially increase screening, be cost-\nsaving (172), and identify infections among patients who do \nnot disclose sexual behavior (173).\nHIV Infection\nHIV screening should be discussed and offered to all", "n_chars": 4542, "n_tokens_est": 1135, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.769035Z"}

The following recommendations \nfor primary prevention of STIs (i.e., vaccination and \ncounseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for \nsexually active adolescents and young adults from federal \nagencies and medical professional organizations.\n• HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years \nfor those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of \n11 or 12 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-\nrecs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).\n• The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents \nand young adults who have not previously received the universal \nHBV vaccine series during childhood (12).\n• The HAV vaccination series should be offered to \nadolescents and young adults as well as those who have \nnot previously received the universal HAV vaccine series \nduring childhood ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/\nschedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html#note-hepa).\n• Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, \nand implications of infection should be regarded as an essential \ncomponent of the anticipatory guidance provided to all \nadolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to \nadolescents weighing ≥35 kg and adults who are HIV \nnegative and at substantial risk for HIV infection (80,178). \nYMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings \nwith tailored adherence support (e.g., text messaging and \nvisits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP , initial \nand follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing \nrecommendations are the same for adolescents and adults \n(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep).\n• Medical providers who care for adolescents and young \nadults should integrate sexuality education into clinical \npractice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents \nabout the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for \nacquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding \nevidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a \ndiscussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction \nbehaviors (e.g., consistent and correct condom use and \nreduction in the number of sex partners including \nconcurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches \n(e.g., patient-centered counseling and motivational \ninterviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention \nstrategies and are recommended by USPSTF . Educational \nmaterials (e.g., handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can \nreinforce office-based educational efforts.\nChildren\nManagement of children who have STIs requires close \ncooperation among clinicians, laboratorians, and child-\nprotection authorities. Official investigations, when indicated, \nshould be initiated promptly. Certain diseases (e.g., gonorrhea, \nsyphilis, HIV , chlamydia, and trichomoniasis), if acquired after \nthe neonatal period, strongly indicate sexual contact. For other \ndiseases (e.g., HSV , HPV and anogenital warts, and vaginitis), \nthe association with sexual contact is not as clear (see Sexual \nAssault and Abuse and STIs).\nMen Who Have Sex with Men\nMSM comprise a diverse group in terms of behaviors, \nidentities, and health care needs (179). The term “MSM” often \nis used clinically to refer to sexual behavior alone, regardless of \nsexual orientation (e.g., a person might identify as heterosexual \nbut still be classified as MSM). Sexual orientation is \nindependent of gender identity.

Classification of MSM can vary \nin the inclusion of transgender men and women on the basis \nof whether men are defined by sex at birth (i.e., transgender \nwomen included) or current gender identity (i.e., transgender\nmen included). Therefore, sexual orientation as well as gender \nidentity of individual persons and their sex partners should be \nobtained during health care visits. MSM might be at increased \nrisk for HIV and other STIs because of their sexual network or \nbehavioral or biologic factors, including number of concurrent \npartners, condomless sex, anal sex, or substance use (180–182). \nThese factors, along with sexual network or higher community \ndisease prevalence, can increase the risk for STIs among MSM \ncompared with other groups (183,184).\nPerforming a detailed and comprehensive sexual history is \nthe first step in identifying vulnerability and providing tailored \ncounseling and care ( 3). Factors associated with increased \nvulnerability to STI acquisition among MSM include having \nmultiple partners, anonymous partners, and concurrent \npartners (185,186).

In \nthe United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection \namong MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at \none in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253 (191). These \ndisparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with \nAfrican American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a \none in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, \nrespectively. For HIV , transmission occurs much more readily \nthrough receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex \n(192). Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous \npartners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated \nwith HIV infection (193– 196). Importantly, other STIs \nalso might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection \n(197–199). An estimated 10% of new HIV infections were \nattributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection ( 81). A \nsubstantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV \ndiagnosis ( 200). Clinical care involving MSM, including \nthose who have HIV infection, should involve asking about \nSTI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians \nshould routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and \nsymptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral \ndischarge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and \nanorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis \n(e.g., discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain \nduring anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, \nespecially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing \nis recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide \neducation and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex \napproaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing \nSTI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, \nand Referral).\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\nPrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection \nbefore exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral \nmedication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, \nand specifically among MSM ( 74,75,201). PrEP guidelines \nprovide information regarding sexually active persons who are at \nsubstantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or \nvaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner \nwith HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or \ninconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons \nwho inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing \ninjection equipment) (80). Those guidelines provide information \nregarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) \nor tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening \nfor bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all \nsexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or \namong patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP \nmight compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using \ncondoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways \n(202,203), although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. \nStudies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of \nSTIs, and frequent screening is warranted (204–206).\nImportance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing\nRectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea \nand chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health \nconsideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are \nassociated with HIV infection (82,207), and men with repeat \nrectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV \nacquisition ( 208). Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or \nchlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections \n(209–211).

Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or \nchlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections \n(209–211). Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, \nprevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from\n0.2% to 24% and 2.1% to 23%, respectively, and prevalence \nof pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.5% to \n16.5% and 0% to 3.6%, respectively (171). Approximately \n70% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be \nmissed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM \n(212–216) because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are \nasymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be \nan acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal \nspecimens (217– 219), which can enhance patient comfort \nand reduce clinical workloads.\nA detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to \nidentify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. \nClinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should \nconsider implementing routine extragenital screening for \nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is \nlikely to be cost-effective (220).\nScreening Recommendations\nSTI screening among MSM has been reported to be \nsuboptimal. In a cross-sectional sample of MSM in the United \nStates, approximately one third reported not having had an \nSTI test during the previous 3 years, and MSM with multiple \nsex partners reported less frequent screening ( 221). MSM \nliving with HIV infection and engaged in care also experience \nsuboptimal rates of STI testing (222,223).

Furthermore, MSM screening coverage \nneeded for eliminating syphilis among a population is \nsubstantially reduced from 62% with annual screening to 23% \nwith quarterly screening (226,227). In an MSM transmission \nmodel that explored the impact of HIV PrEP use on STI \nprevalence, quarterly chlamydia and gonorrhea screening was \nassociated with an 83% reduction in incidence (205). The only \nempiric data available that examined the impact of screening \nfrequency come from an observational cohort of MSM using \nHIV PrEP in which quarterly screening identified more \nbacterial STIs, and semiannual screening would have resulted \nin delayed treatment of 35% of total identified STI infections \n(206). In addition, quarterly screening was reported to have \nprevented STI exposure in a median of three sex partners \nper STI infection (206). On the basis of available evidence, \nquarterly screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis for \ncertain sexually active MSM can improve case finding, which \ncan reduce the duration of infection at the population level, \nreduce ongoing transmission and, ultimately, prevalence among \nthis population (228).\nPreventive screening for common STIs is indicated for all \nMSM. The following screening recommendations summarize \npublished federal agency and USPSTF clinical prevention \nguidelines for MSM and should be performed at least annually.\nHIV Infection\nHIV serologic testing is indicated if HIV status is unknown \nor if HIV negative and the patient or their sex partner has had \nmore than one sex partner since the most recent HIV test.\nSyphilis\nSyphilis serologic testing is indicated to establish whether \npersons with reactive tests have untreated syphilis, have partially \ntreated syphilis, or are manifesting a slow or inadequate \nserologic response to recommended previous therapy.\nGonorrhea and Chlamydia\nThe following testing is recommended for MSM:\n• A test for urethral infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and \nC. trachomatis among men who have had insertive \nintercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT \nis preferred).\n• A test for rectal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and \nC. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal \nintercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT \nis preferred).\n* Regardless of condom use during exposure.\n• A test for pharyngeal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae among \nmen who have had receptive oral intercourse during the \npreceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).\n• T esting for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not \nrecommended.\nBasing screening practices solely on history might be \nsuboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable \ntaking a detailed sexual history (229), men might also feel \nuncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with \ntheir provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be \nidentified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors (171). \nFurthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e., \noral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and \nC. trachomatis has not been well studied (230–232).\nRectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-\ncollected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who \nreport exposure at these sites.

More frequent screening depends \non ongoing risk behaviors, high-risk sexual behavior, and \nconcomitant ulcerative STIs or STI-related proctitis. Sexual \ntransmission of HCV can occur and is most common among \nMSM with HIV infection (234–237). Screening for HCV in \nthis setting is cost-effective ( 238,239). Screening should be \nperformed by using HCV antibody assays followed by HCV \nRNA testing for those with a positive antibody test. Suspicion \nfor acute HCV infection (e.g., clinical evidence of hepatitis and \nrisk behaviors) should prompt consideration for HCV RNA \ntesting, despite a negative antibody test.\nHuman Papillomavirus\nHPV infection and associated conditions (e.g., anogenital \nwarts and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions) are highly \nprevalent among MSM. The HPV vaccination is recommended \nfor all men, including MSM and transgender persons or \nimmunocompromised males, including those with HIV \ninfection, through age 26 years ( 11).

One study \ndemonstrated that monthly oral administration of a 1-g dose \nof azithromycin reduced infection with N. gonorrhoeae and \nC. trachomatis but did not decrease the incidence of HIV \ntransmission (240). Among MSM, doxycycline taken as PEP in \na single oral dose ≤24 hours after sex decreased infection with \nTreponema pallidum and C. trachomatis; however, no substantial \neffect was observed for infection with N. gonorrhoeae (93). \nDoxycycline taken as STI PrEP as 100 mg orally once daily \nalso demonstrated a substantial reduction in gonorrhea, \nchlamydia, and syphilis among MSM (90). However, these \nstudies had limitations because of small sample size, short \nduration of therapy, and concerns about antibiotic resistance, \nspecifically regarding N. gonorrhoeae (241). Further study is \nneeded to determine the effectiveness of using antimicrobials \nfor STI PrEP or PEP .\nCounseling and Education Approaches\nDifferent counseling and STI prevention strategies are \nneeded to effectively engage different groups of MSM. \nOutreach efforts should be guided by local surveillance efforts \nand community input.

Global increases in the incidence \nof shigellosis among adult MSM have been more recently \nobserved (252– 256). Sporadic outbreaks of Shigella sonnei\n \nand Shigella flexneri have been reported among MSM \n(257–262). T ransmission occurs through oral-anal contact \nor sexual contact, and transmission efficiency is enhanced by \nboth biologic or host and behavioral factors. HIV without \nviral suppression can be an independent risk factor that \ncan contribute to transmission by increasing shedding of \nthe enteric pathogen, increasing susceptibility of the host, \nor both ( 255,263).

Behavioral characteristics \nassociated with the sexual transmission of enteric infections \nare broadly similar to those associated with other STIs (e.g., \ngonorrhea, syphilis, and lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]). \nThis includes multiple sex partners and online hookup sites \nthat increase opportunities for sexual mixing, which might \ncreate dense sexual networks that facilitate STI transmission \namong MSM (270). Specific behaviors associated with sexually \ntransmitted enteric infections among MSM involve attendance \nat sex parties and recreational drug use including chem sex \n(i.e., using crystal methamphetamine, gamma-butyrolactone, \nor mephedrone before or during sex), which might facilitate \ncondomless sex, group sex, fisting, use of sex toys, and scat play \n(253,271). The growing number of sexually transmitted enteric \ninfections might be attributable in part to the emergence of \nantimicrobial resistance. This is well reported regarding Shigella \nspecies, for which rapid intercontinental dissemination of a \nS. flexneri 3a lineage with high-level resistance to azithromycin \nthrough sexual transmission among MSM (272) and clusters \nof multidrug resistant shigella cases among MSM have recently \nbeen reported (273). Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter species \nhave also been documented (266,274). For MSM patients with \ndiarrhea, clinicians should request laboratory examinations, \nincluding stool culture; provide counseling about the risk for \ninfection with enteric pathogens during sexual activity (oral-\nanal, oral-genital, anal-genital, and digital-anal contact) that \ncould expose them to enteric pathogens; and choose treatment, \nwhen needed, according to antimicrobial drug susceptibility.\nWomen Who Have Sex with Women and \nWomen Who Have Sex with \nWomen and Men\nWSW and WSWM comprise diverse groups with variations \nin sexual identity, practices, and risk behaviors. Studies \nindicate that certain WSW , particularly adolescents, young \nwomen, and WSWM, might be at increased risk for STIs \nand HIV on the basis of reported risk behaviors ( 275–280). \nStudies have highlighted the diversity of sexual practices and \nexamined use of protective or risk-reduction strategies among \nWSW populations (281–283). Use of barrier protection with \nfemale partners (e.g., gloves during digital-genital sex, external \ncondoms with sex toys, and latex or plastic barriers [also known \nas dental dams for oral-genital sex]) was infrequent in all \nstudies. Although health organizations have online materials \ndirected to patients, few comprehensive and reliable resources \nof sexual health information for WSW are available (284).\nRecent studies regarding STI rates among WSW and \nWSWM indicate that WSWM experience higher rates of STIs \nthan WSW , with rates comparable with women who have sex \nwith men (WSM) in all studies reviewed (279,285,286). These \nstudies indicate that WSW might experience STIs at lower \nrates than WSWM and WSM, although still at significant \nrates (287). One study reported higher sexual-risk behaviors \namong adolescent WSWM and WSW than among adolescent \nWSM (280). WSW report reduced knowledge of STI risks \n(288), and both WSW and WSWM experience barriers to care, \nespecially Black WSW and WSWM (289,290).

Practices involving \ndigital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared \npenetrative sex items, present a possible means for transmission \nof infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions. This possibility \nis most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas \ninfections ( 293,294) and by concordant drug-resistance \ngenotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying \nHIV transmitted sexually between women ( 295,296).

A U.S. population-based survey \namong women aged 18–59 years demonstrated an HSV-2 \nseroprevalence of 30% among women reporting same-sex \npartners during the previous year, 36% among women \nreporting same-sex partners in their lifetime, and 24% among \nwomen reporting no lifetime same-sex behavior (299). HSV-2 \nseroprevalence among women self-identifying as homosexual \nor lesbian was 8%, similar to a previous clinic-based study of \nWSW (299,305) but was 26% among Black WSW in one \nstudy (287). The relatively frequent practice of orogenital sex \namong WSW and WSWM might place them at higher risk \nfor genital infection with HSV-1, a hypothesis supported by \nthe recognized association between HSV-1 seropositivity and \nprevious number of female partners. Thus, sexual transmission \nof HSV-1 and HSV-2 can occur between female sex partners. \nThis information should be communicated to women as part \nof sexual health counseling.\nT richomonas is a relatively common infection among WSW \nand WSWM, with prevalence rates higher than for chlamydia \nor gonorrhea (306,307), and direct transmission of trichomonas \nbetween female partners has been demonstrated (293,294).\nLimited information is available regarding transmission \nof bacterial STIs between female partners. T ransmission of \nsyphilis between female sex partners, probably through oral \nsex, has been reported. Although the rate of transmission of \nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae between women is unknown, \ninfection also might be acquired from past or current male \npartners. Data indicate that C. trachomatis infection among \nWSW can occur (275, 286, 308, 309). Data are limited \nregarding gonorrhea rates among WSW and WSWM (170). \nReports of same-sex behavior among women should not deter \nproviders from offering and providing screening for STIs, \nincluding chlamydia, according to guidelines.\nBV is common among women, and even more so among \nwomen with female partners (310–312). Epidemiologic data \nstrongly demonstrate that BV is sexually transmitted among \nwomen with female partners. Evidence continues to support \nthe association of such sexual behaviors as having a new partner, \nhaving a partner with BV , having receptive oral sex, and having \ndigital-vaginal and digital-anal sex with incident BV (313,314). \nA study including monogamous couples demonstrated \nthat female sex partners frequently share identical genital \nLactobacillus strains (315). Within a community-based \ncohort of WSW , extravaginal (i.e., oral and rectal) reservoirs \nof BV-associated bacteria were a risk factor for incident BV \n(316).

Clinicians can improve the experience of sexual health \nscreening and counseling for transgender persons by asking for \ntheir choice of terminology or modifying language (e.g., asking \npatients their gender pronouns) to be used during clinic visits \nand history taking and examination (343).

Recent data from the STD Surveillance Network \ndemonstrated higher prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia \namong transgender men, similar to rates reported among \ncisgender MSM (365).\nThe U.S. T ransgender Survey indicated that the proportion \nof transgender men and gender diverse persons assigned \nfemale sex at birth who have undergone gender-affirmation \ngenital surgery is low. Providers should consider the anatomic \ndiversity among transgender men because a person can undergo \na metoidioplasty (a procedure to increase the length of the \nclitoris), with or without urethral lengthening, and might not \nhave a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and therefore be at risk \nfor bacterial STIs, HPV , HSV , HIV , and cervical cancer (366). \nFor transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy, \nthe decrease in estradiol levels caused by exogenous testosterone \ncan lead to vaginal atrophy (367,368) and is associated with a \nhigh prevalence of unsatisfactory sample acquisition (369). The \nimpact of these hormonal changes on mucosal susceptibility \nto HIV and STIs is unknown.\nT ransgender men who have not chosen to undergo \nhysterectomy with removal of the cervix remain at risk for \ncervical cancer. These persons often avoid cervical cancer \nscreening because of multiple factors, including discomfort \nwith medical examinations and fear of discrimination \n(338,370). Providers should be aware that conducting a \nspeculum examination can be technically difficult after \nmetoidioplasty surgery because of narrowing of the introitus. \nIn these situations, high-risk HPV testing using a swab can \nbe considered; self-collected swabs for high-risk HPV testing \nhas been reported to be an acceptable option for transgender \nmen (371).\nScreening Recommendations\nThe following are screening recommendations for \ntransgender and gender diverse persons:\n• Because of the diversity of transgender persons regarding \nsurgical gender-affirming procedures, hormone use, and \ntheir patterns of sexual behavior, providers should remain \naware of symptoms consistent with common STIs and \nscreen for asymptomatic infections on the basis of the \npatient’s sexual practices and anatomy.\n• Gender-based screening recommendations should be \nadapted on the basis of anatomy (e.g., routine screening \nfor C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae) as recommended \nfor all sexually active females aged <25 years on an annual \nbasis and should be extended to transgender men and \nnonbinary persons with a cervix among this age group.\n• HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all \ntransgender persons. Frequency of repeat screenings should \nbe based on level of risk.\n• For transgender persons with HIV infection who have sex \nwith cisgender men and transgender women, STI \nscreening should be conducted at least annually, including \nsyphilis serology, HCV testing, and urogenital and \nextragenital NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia.\n• T ransgender women who have had vaginoplasty surgery \nshould undergo routine STI screening for all exposed sites \n(e.g., oral, anal, or vaginal).

Syphilis seroprevalence rates, \nwhich can indicate previously treated or current infection, are \nconsiderably higher among incarcerated adult men and women \nthan among adolescents, which is consistent with the overall \nnational syphilis trends (141,374). Detection and treatment \nof early syphilis in correctional facilities might affect rates \nof transmission among adults and prevention of congenital \nsyphilis (377).\nIn jails, approximately half of entrants are released back \ninto the community within 48 hours. As a result, treatment \ncompletion rates for those screened for STIs and who receive \nSTI diagnoses in short-term facilities might not be optimal. \nHowever, because of the mobility of incarcerated populations \nin and out of the community, the impact of screening in \ncorrectional facilities on the prevalence of infections among \ndetainees and subsequent transmission in the community \nafter release might be considerable (378). Moreover, treatment \ncompletion rates of ≥95% in short-term facilities can be \nachieved by offering screening at or shortly after intake, \nthus facilitating earlier receipt of test results and, if needed, \nfollow-up of untreated persons can be conducted through \npublic health outreach.\nUniversal, opt-out screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea \namong females aged ≤35 years entering juvenile and adult \ncorrectional facilities is recommended ( 379).

Ultimately, \npersons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, \nlife-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e., AIDS).\nEffective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable \nlevels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and \nprevents sexual transmission of HIV to others ( 95–97,410–\n412). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are \nessential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the \nInternational AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all \npersons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon \nas possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to \nprevent HIV transmission (413).\nSTD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in \nreducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics \nprovide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need \nof HIV prevention services who are not served by the health \ncare system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis \nof an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among \npersons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, \nrectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (197). STD clinics perform only \napproximately 20% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally \nbut identify approximately 30% of all new infections ( 414). \nAmong testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in \nterms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; \nduring 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with a new \ndiagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days \nincreased from 55% to >90% (415,415).\nScreening Recommendations\nThe following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:\n• HIV testing is recommended for all persons seeking STI \nevaluation who are not already known to have HIV infection. \nT esting should be routine at the time of the STI evaluation, \nregardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral \nrisks for HIV . T esting for HIV should be performed at the time \nof STI diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial \nSTI evaluation and screening (82,195,416).\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least \nonce for all persons aged 15–65 years (417).\n• Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including \nsexually active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be \nscreened for HIV at least annually. Providers can consider \nthe benefits of offering more frequent screening (e.g., every \n3–6 months) among MSM at increased risk for acquiring \nHIV (418,419).\n• All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered \nand is recommended for women who are at high risk for \nacquiring HIV infection, women who receive health care \nin jurisdictions with high rates of HIV , and women \nexamined in clinical settings in which HIV incidence is \n≥1 per 1,000 women screened per year (138,140). \n• HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. \nPatients should not be tested without their knowledge.\n• Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV \ntest will be performed, unless the patient declines) is \nrecommended in all health care settings.

For persons with \nsubstantial risk whose results are HIV negative, providers \nshould offer or provide referral for PrEP services, unless \nthe last potential HIV exposure occurred <72 hours, in \nwhich case PEP might be indicated.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nHIV infection can be diagnosed by HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab \ncombination immunoassays. All FDA-cleared HIV tests are \nhighly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can \ndetect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect \nHIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and \ngroup N).\nAccording to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC \nrecommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratory-\nbased HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if \nrepeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay \nwith a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation \nassay (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872). This algorithm \nconfers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 \nantibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is \nuncommon in the United States, accurate identification is \nvital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from \nthat for HIV-1 ( 420). RNA testing should be performed \non all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative \nsupplemental antibody test results to determine whether the \ndiscordance represents acute HIV infection.\nRapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a \npreliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in <20 minutes. The \nmajority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the \ncourse of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based \nassays and thus can produce negative results among persons \nrecently infected (e.g., acutely infected persons). Furthermore, \nHIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore \nwill not detect acute HIV infection. If early or acute infection \nis suspected and a rapid HIV antibody assay is negative, \nconfirmatory testing with combined laboratory-based assays or \nRNA testing should be performed. CDC recommends that all \npersons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratory-\nbased Ag/Ab assay. Additional details about interpretation of \nresults by using the HIV testing algorithm recommended by \nCDC are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/48472.\nAcute HIV Infection\nProviders serving persons at risk for STIs are in a position \nto diagnose HIV infection during its acute phase. Diagnosing \nHIV infection during the acute phase is particularly important \nbecause persons with acute HIV have highly infectious \ndisease due to the concentration of virus in plasma and \ngenital secretions, which is extremely elevated during that \nstage of infection ( 421,422) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\nhiv-infection?view=full ). ART during acute HIV infection \nis recommended because it substantially reduces infection \ntransmission to others, improves laboratory markers of \ndisease, might decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral \nsetpoint, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases \nthe rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and \npreserves immune function ( https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\nhiv-infection?view=full).

Early HIV diagnosis \nand treatment is thus not only vital for individual health but also as \na public health intervention to prevent new infections. Knowledge \nof the prevention benefit of treatment can help reduce stigma and \nincrease the person’s commitment to start and remain adherent \nto ART (423). The importance of adherence should be stressed \nas well as the fact that ART does not protect against other STIs \nthat can be prevented by using condoms. Interventions to assist \npersons to remain adherent to their prescribed HIV treatment, to \notherwise reduce the possibility of transmission to others, and to \nprotect themselves against STIs, have been developed for diverse \npopulations at risk (424) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/\nfiles/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).\nComprehensive HIV treatment and care services might not \nbe available in facilities focused primarily on STI treatment. \nProviders in such settings should be knowledgeable about HIV \ntreatment and care options available in their communities \nand promptly link persons who have newly diagnosed HIV \ninfection and any persons with HIV infection who are not \nengaged in ongoing effective care to a health care provider \nor facility experienced in caring for persons living with HIV \n(https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/\nAdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).\nOther HIV Management Considerations\nBehavioral and psychosocial services are integral to caring for \npersons with HIV infection. Providers should expect persons \nto be distressed when first informed that they have HIV . They \nface multiple adaptive challenges, including coping with the \nreactions of others to a stigmatizing illness, developing and \nadopting strategies to maintain physical and emotional health, \ninitiating changes in behavior to prevent HIV transmission to \nothers, and reducing the risk for acquiring additional STIs. \nMany persons will require assistance gaining access to health \ncare and other support services and coping with changes in \npersonal relationships.\nPersons with HIV infection might have additional needs \n(e.g., referral for substance use or mental health disorders). \nOthers require assistance to secure and maintain employment \nand housing. Persons capable of reproduction might require \nfamily planning counseling, information about reproductive \nhealth choices, and referral for reproductive health care.\nThe following recommendations apply to managing persons \nwith diagnosed HIV infection:\n• Link persons with HIV infection to care and start them \non ART as soon as possible.\n• Report cases (in accordance with local requirements) to \npublic health and initiate partner services.\n• Provide prevention counseling to persons with diagnosed \nHIV infection.\n• Ensure all persons with HIV infection are informed that \nif they achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load, they \nhave effectively no risk for transmitting HIV . Stress that \na suppressed viral load is not a substitute for condoms and \nbehavioral modifications because ART does not protect \npersons with HIV against other STIs.\n• Provide additional counseling, either on-site or through \nreferral, about the psychosocial and medical implications \nof having HIV infection.\n• Assess the need for immediate medical care and \npsychosocial support.\n• Link persons with diagnosed HIV infection to services \nprovided by health care personnel experienced in managing \nHIV infection.

Specific testing \nincludes syphilis serology and NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and \nC. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure.

Early diagnosis and treatment \nof HIV among all potentially exposed sexual and injecting \ndrug sharing partners can improve their health and reduce \nnew infections. For those partners without HIV infection, \npartner services also provide an opportunity for offering HIV \nprevention services, including PrEP or PEP (if exposure was \n<72 hours previous) and STI testing and treatment.\nHealth care providers should inform persons with diagnosed \nHIV infection about any legal obligations of providers to report \ncases of HIV to public health; the local confidential processes \nfor managing partner services, including that a public health \ndepartment still might be in contact to follow up in their care \nand partner services; and the benefits and risks of partner \nnotification and services. Health care providers should also \nencourage persons with a new HIV diagnosis to notify their \npartners and provide them with referral information for their \npartners about HIV testing. Partner notification for exposure \nto HIV should be confidential. Health care providers can assist \nin the partner notification process, either directly or by referral \nto health department partner notification programs. Health \ndepartment staff are trained to use public health investigation \nstrategies for confidentially locating persons who can benefit \nfrom HIV treatment, care, or prevention services. Guidance \nregarding spousal notification varies by jurisdiction. Detailed \nrecommendations for notification, evaluation, and treatment of \nexposed partners are available in Recommendations for Partner \nServices Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and \nChlamydial Infections (111).\nSpecial Considerations\nPregnancy\nAll pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered and \nis recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring \nHIV , women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high \nrates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings \nin which prenatal screening identifies ≥1 pregnant woman \nwith HIV per 1,000 women screened ( 138). Diagnostic \nalgorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from \nthose for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among \nSpecial Populations). Pregnant women should be informed \nthat HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel \nof prenatal tests (138); for women who decline HIV testing, \nproviders should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss \nthe benefits of testing (e.g., early HIV detection, treatment, and \ncare for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal \ntransmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent \nprenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have \nhad a previous negative HIV test result should be informed \nabout the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. \nWomen with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the \ntime of delivery.\nT esting pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of \ninfection status can help maintain the woman’s health, and \nit enables receipt of interventions (i.e., ART or specialized \nobstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for \nperinatal transmission of HIV .

GUDs (e.g., \nsyphilis, herpes, and LGV) might also present as oral ulcers. \nGenital herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and chancroid \nhave been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition \nand transmission. Genital, anal, or perianal lesions can also be \nassociated with infectious and noninfectious conditions that \nare not sexually transmitted (e.g., yeast, trauma, carcinoma, \naphthae or Behcet’s disease, fixed drug eruption, or psoriasis).\nA diagnosis based only on medical history and physical \nexamination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all \npersons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be \nevaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \nincludes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination \nfrom lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT \nor culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing \nfor type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is \nprevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should \nbe performed.\nNo FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available \nin the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs \nare available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital \nspecimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their \nown syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification \nstudies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for \nHSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes \n(see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with \nimmunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers \nthat are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV \ntesting should be performed on all persons not known to have \nHIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \n(see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). \nNAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for \ncases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g., oral manifestations \nof syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs \nhave not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, \nthey can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory \nrequirements for an off-label procedure.\nBecause early syphilis treatment decreases transmission \npossibility, public health standards require health care \nproviders to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected \ncase of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test \nresults are available. Presumptive treatment of a patient with a \nsuspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended \nbecause HSV treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy \ninitiation. The clinician should choose the presumptive \ntreatment on the basis of the clinical presentation (i.e., HSV \nlesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule) and \nepidemiologic circumstances (e.g., high incidence of disease \namong populations and communities and travel history). For \nexample, syphilis is so common among MSM that any male \nwho has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be \npresumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis \nand HSV tests are performed.

Worldwide, several isolates with \nintermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin \nhave been reported. However, because cultures are not routinely \nperformed, and chancroid is uncommon, data are limited \nregarding prevalence of H. ducreyi antimicrobial resistance.\nOther Management Considerations\nMen who are uncircumcised and persons with HIV infection \ndo not respond as well to treatment as persons who are \ncircumcised or are HIV negative ( 430). Patients should be \ntested for HIV at the time chancroid is diagnosed. If the initial \nHIV test results were negative, the provider can consider the \nbenefits of offering more frequent testing and HIV PrEP to \npersons at increased risk for HIV infection.\nFollow-Up\nPatients should be reexamined 3–7 days after therapy \ninitiation. If treatment is successful, ulcers usually improve \nsymptomatically within 3 days and objectively within 7 days \nafter therapy. If no clinical improvement is evident, the clinician \nshould consider whether the diagnosis is correct, another STI \nis present, the patient has HIV infection, the treatment was \nnot used as instructed, or the H. ducreyi strain causing the \ninfection is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial. The time \nrequired for complete healing depends on the size of the ulcer; \nlarge ulcers might require >2 weeks. In addition, healing can \nbe slower for uncircumcised men who have ulcers under the \nforeskin. Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is \nslower than that of ulcers and might require needle aspiration \nor incision and drainage, despite otherwise successful therapy. \nAlthough needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler procedure, \nincision and drainage might be preferred because of reduced \nneed for subsequent drainage procedures.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nRegardless of whether disease symptoms are present, sex \npartners of patients with chancroid should be examined and \ntreated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the \n10 days preceding the patient’s symptom onset.\nSpecial Considerations\nPregnancy\nData indicate ciprofloxacin presents a low risk to the \nfetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during \nbreastfeeding (431). Alternative drugs should be used if the \npatient is pregnant or lactating. No adverse effects of chancroid \non pregnancy outcome have been reported.\nHIV Infection\nPersons with HIV infection who have chancroid infection \nshould be monitored closely because they are more likely to \nexperience chancroid treatment failure and to have ulcers \nthat heal slowly (430,432). Persons with HIV might require \nrepeated or longer courses of therapy, and treatment failures \ncan occur with any regimen. Data are limited concerning \nthe therapeutic efficacy of the recommended single-dose \nazithromycin and ceftriaxone regimens among persons with \nHIV infection.\nChildren\nBecause sexual contact is the major primary transmission route \namong U.S. patients, diagnosis of chancroid ulcers among infants \nand children, especially in the genital or perineal region, is highly \nsuspicious of sexual abuse. However, H. ducreyi is recognized as a \nmajor cause of nonsexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers among \nchildren in tropical regions and, specifically, countries where \nyaws is endemic (433–435).

If genital lesions are present, \nclinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-\nspecific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture (186). \nRecurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for \nHSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes \n(439,440). Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which \nHSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to \naid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital \nlesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests \nfor HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care \nto persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection \nincreases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, \nall persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV (441).\nVirologic Tests\nHSV NAAT assays are the most sensitive tests because \nthey detect HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous \nlesions; these tests are increasingly available ( 442–444). \nAlthough multiple FDA-cleared assays exist for HSV detection, \nthese tests vary in sensitivity from 90.9% to 100%; however, \nthey are considered highly specific ( 445–447). PCR is also \nthe test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the \ncentral nervous system (CNS) and systemic infections (e.g., \nmeningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). HSV PCR \nof the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital \nherpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for \ndisseminated infection (e.g., hepatitis). In certain settings, viral \nculture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral \nculture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases \nrapidly as lesions begin to heal ( 443,448). Viral culture \nisolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine \nwhether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to \ndetect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence \nof older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not \nindicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding \nis intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in \nthe absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital \nHSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result \ndoes not exclude the presence of HSV infection.\nCytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV \ninfection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing \ngenital lesions (i.e., Tzanck preparation) and therefore should \nnot be relied on. Although a direct immunofluorescence \nassay using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is also \navailable for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens, \nthis assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended (449).\nType-Specific Serologic Tests\nBoth type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV \ndevelop during the first weeks after infection and persist \nindefinitely. The majority of available, accurate type-\nspecific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific \nglycoprotein G2 (gG2) (HSV-2) and glycoprotein G1 (gG1) \n(HSV-1). Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish \nbetween HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific \nserologic assays should be requested (450–452).\nBoth laboratory-based assays and POC tests that provide \nresults for HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum \nduring a clinic visit are available. The sensitivity of glycoprotein \nG type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from \n80% to 98%; false-negative results might be more frequent", "n_chars": 4569, "n_tokens_est": 1142, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.770977Z"}

The sensitivity of glycoprotein \nG type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from \n80% to 98%; false-negative results might be more frequent\nat early stages of infection ( 451,453,454). Therefore, in \ncases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat type-\nspecific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time \nof acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, \nHerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is \nfalsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0) (457–457). One \nstudy reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity \nof 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9 (458). Because of the \npoor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, \nparticularly with low index values (<3.0), a confirmatory test \n(Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be \nperformed before test interpretation. Use of confirmatory \ntesting with the Biokit or the Western blot assays have been \nreported to improve accuracy of HSV-2 serologic testing (459). \nThe HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for \nconfirmation because it uses the same antigen as the HSV-2 \nEIA.

In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing \nhas low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody ( 458). \nHowever, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, \nand HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic (437–\n439,461,462). Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by \nvirologic tests from genital lesions.\nType-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing \nHSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or \natypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV \nPCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes \nwithout laboratory confirmation, and a patient’s partner has \ngenital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general \npopulation is not recommended. Patients who are at higher \nrisk for infection (e.g., those presenting for an STI evaluation, \nespecially for persons with ≥10 lifetime sex partners, and \npersons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a \nhistory of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific \nHSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with \ngenital symptoms.\nGenital Herpes Management\nAntiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic \npatients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for \nuse of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection \nare to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences \nand improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent \ntransmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the \nnatural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal \ntransmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also \nintegral to clinical management.\nSystemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and \nsymptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and \nrecurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. \nHowever, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect \nthe risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug \nis discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three \nFDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit \nfor genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir \n(463–471). Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has \nenhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for \nless frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high \noral bioavailability. T opical therapy with antiviral drugs offers \nminimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.\nFirst Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes\nNewly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged \nclinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic \ninvolvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have \nmild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or \nprolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, \nall patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive \nantiviral therapy.\nRecommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital \nHerpes*\nAcyclovir† 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\nor\nFamciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\nor\nValacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days\n* Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.\n† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not \nrecommended because of the frequency of dosing.\nRecurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes\nAlmost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 \ngenital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of \ngenital lesions.

Such couples should be encouraged to consider \nsuppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing \ntransmission, in addition to consistent condom use and \navoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive \nantiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic \ngenital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used \nby those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive \npersons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes \nhave a 50% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared \nwith those with symptomatic genital herpes (476). No data \nare available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for \npreventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in \nwhich a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection \nidentified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 \nseropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC \nand intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk \nfor HSV-2 shedding or recurrences (477).\nRecommended Regimens for Suppression of Recurrent HSV-2 \nGenital Herpes\nAcyclovir 400 mg orally 2 times/day\nor\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day*\nor\nValacyclovir 1 g orally once a day\nor\nFamciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day\n* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other \nvalacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent \nrecurrences (i.e., ≥10 episodes/year).\nFamciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of \nviral shedding (478). Ease of administration and cost also are \nkey considerations for prolonged treatment.\nRecurrent HSV-1 Genital Herpes\nRecurrences are less frequent after the first episode of HSV-1 \ngenital herpes, compared with genital HSV-2 genital herpes, \nand genital shedding rapidly decreases during the first year of \ninfection (479). No data are available regarding the efficacy \nof suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among \npersons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection. Because of \nthe decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive \ntherapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those \nwith frequent recurrences through shared clinical decision-\nmaking between the patient and the provider.\nEpisodic Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes\nEpisodic treatment of recurrent herpes is most effective if \ntherapy is initiated within 1 day of lesion onset or during the \nprodrome that precedes some outbreaks. The patient should \nbe provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the \nmedication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately \nwhen symptoms begin.

HSV meningitis should be distinguished from \nencephalitis, which requires a longer course (14–21 days) of \nIV therapy. Impaired renal function warrants an adjustment \nin acyclovir dosage.\nHepatitis\nHepatitis is a rare manifestation of disseminated HSV \ninfection, often reported among pregnant women who \nacquire HSV during pregnancy ( 484). Pregnant women in \nany trimester can present with fever and hepatitis (markedly \nelevated transaminases) but might not have any genital or skin \nlesions. HSV hepatitis is associated with fulminant liver failure \nand high mortality (25%). Therefore, a high index of suspicion \nfor HSV is necessary, with a confirmatory diagnosis by HSV \nPCR from blood (485). Among pregnant women with fever \nand unexplained severe hepatitis, disseminated HSV infection \nshould be considered, and empiric IV acyclovir should be \ninitiated pending confirmation (484).\nPrevention\nConsistent and correct condom use has been reported \nin multiple studies to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk \nfor HSV-2 transmission from men to women ( 486–488). \nCondoms are less effective for preventing transmission from \nwomen to men (489 ). T wo randomized clinical trials of \nmedical male circumcision (MMC) demonstrated a decreased \nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among men in Uganda and \nSouth Africa ( 66,68). Results from a third trial conducted \nin Kenya did not demonstrate a substantial difference in \nHSV-2 acquisition among men who received MMC (490). \nA systematic review indicated high consistency for decreased \nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among women with a male partner \nwho underwent MMC (491). These data indicate that MMC \ncan be associated with decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition \namong adult heterosexual men and with decreased risk for \nHSV-2 transmission from male to female partners.\nRandomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PrEP with \ndaily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition \nby 30% in heterosexual partnerships ( 492). Pericoital \nintravaginal tenofovir 1% gel also decreases the risk for HSV-2 \nacquisition among heterosexual women (493). Among MSM \nand transgender women, daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the \nrisk for severe ulcers with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection \nbut not for HSV-2 acquisition (494). Insufficient evidence \nexists that TDF/FTC use among those who are not at risk for \nHIV acquisition will prevent HSV-2 infection, and it should \nnot be used for that sole purpose. Oral TDF does not prevent \nHSV-2 acquisition among persons with HIV infection who \nare taking TDF as part of their ART regimen (495). No data \nindicate that antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) \ncan be taken as PrEP by persons without HSV-2 to prevent \nits acquisition.\nCounseling\nCounseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex \npartners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling \ninclude helping patients cope with the infection and preventing \nsexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling \ncan be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from \nlearning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute \nillness subsides.

For severe HSV disease, initiating \ntherapy with acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours might \nbe necessary.\nRecommended Regimens for Daily Suppression of Genital \nHerpes Among Persons with HIV Infection\nAcyclovir 400–800 mg orally 2–3 times/day\nor\nFamciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day\nor\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day\nRecommended Regimens for Episodic Genital Herpes Infection \nAmong Persons with HIV Infection\nAcyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5–10 days\nor\nFamciclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days\nor\nValacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 5–10 days\nAntiviral-Resistant HSV Infection\nIf lesions persist or recur in a patient receiving antiviral \ntreatment, acyclovir resistance should be suspected and a viral \nculture obtained for phenotypic sensitivity testing ( 507). \nMolecular testing for acyclovir resistance is not available. \nSuch persons should be managed in consultation with an \ninfectious disease specialist, and alternative therapy should be \nadministered. All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant \nto valacyclovir, and the majority are resistant to famciclovir. \nFoscarnet (40–80 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours until \nclinical resolution is attained) is the treatment of choice for \nacyclovir-resistant genital herpes ( 508,509). Intravenous \ncidofovir 5 mg/kg body weight once weekly might also be \neffective. Foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic medications \nthat require intensive laboratory monitoring and infectious \ndisease specialist consultation. Imiquimod 5% applied to the lesion \nfor 8 hours 3 times/week until clinical resolution is an alternative \nthat has been reported to be effective (510,511). T opical cidofovir \ngel 1% can be applied to lesions 2–4 times daily; however, cidofovir \nmust be compounded at a pharmacy (512).\nPrevention of antiviral resistance remains challenging among \npersons with HIV infection.

For example, such testing might be \noffered to a woman with no history of genital herpes whose \nsex partner has HSV infection. Many fetuses are exposed to \nacyclovir each year, and the medication is believed to be safe \nfor use during all trimesters of pregnancy. A case-control study \nreported an increased risk for the rare neonatal outcome of \ngastroschisis among women who used antiviral medications \nbetween the month before conception and the third month of \npregnancy (518). Acyclovir is also believed to be safe during \nbreastfeeding ( 431,519). Although data regarding prenatal \nexposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data from \nanimal trials indicate that these drugs also pose a low risk \namong pregnant women (520). Acyclovir can be administered \norally to pregnant women with first-episode genital herpes or \nrecurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant \nwomen with severe HSV (see Genital Herpes, Hepatitis). \nSuppressive acyclovir treatment starting at 36 weeks’ gestation \nreduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who \nhave recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of \nrecurrences at term (521–523). However, such treatment might \nnot protect against transmission to neonates in all cases (524). \nNo data support use of antiviral therapy among asymptomatic \nHSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes. \nIn addition, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy among sex \npartners with a history of genital herpes to decrease the risk \nfor HSV transmission to a pregnant woman has not been \nstudied.

LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive \ninfection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A–K that \ncause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations \nof LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. \nRectal exposure among MSM or women can result in \nproctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of \nLGV infection ( 541), and can mimic inflammatory bowel \ndisease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic \nrectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus \n(542,543). Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been \nreported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection \n(544–547). LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic \ninfection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic \ncolorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also \nbeen reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can \nalso be asymptomatic (548).

Prolonged \ntherapy might be required because a delay in resolution of \nsymptoms might occur.\nSyphilis\nSyphilis is a systemic disease caused by T . pallidum. The \ndisease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical \nfindings, which guide treatment and follow-up. Persons who \nhave syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms. \nPrimary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer \nor chancre at the site of infection but can also present with \nmultiple, atypical, or painful lesions (564). Secondary syphilis \nmanifestations can include skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, \nand lymphadenopathy. T ertiary syphilis can present with \ncardiac involvement, gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, and \ngeneral paresis.\nLatent infections (i.e., those lacking clinical manifestations) \nare detected by serologic testing. Latent syphilis acquired \nwithin the preceding year is referred to as early latent syphilis; \nall other cases of latent syphilis are classified as late latent \nsyphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration.\nT . pallidum can infect the CNS, which can occur at any stage \nof syphilis and result in neurosyphilis. Early neurologic clinical \nmanifestations or syphilitic meningitis (e.g., cranial nerve \ndysfunction, meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, stroke, \nand acute altered mental status) are usually present within \nthe first few months or years of infection. Late neurologic \nmanifestations (e.g., tabes dorsalis and general paresis) occur \n10 to >30 years after infection.\nInfection of the visual system (ocular syphilis) or auditory \nsystem (otosyphilis) can occur at any stage of syphilis but is \ncommonly identified during the early stages and can present \nwith or without additional CNS involvement. Ocular syphilis \noften presents as panuveitis but can involve structures in \nboth the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, including \nconjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, posterior interstitial keratitis, \noptic neuropathy, and retinal vasculitis. Ocular syphilis can \nresult in permanent vision loss. Otosyphilis typically presents \nwith cochleo-vestibular symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, \nand sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss can be unilateral or \nbilateral, have a sudden onset, and progress rapidly. Otosyphilis \ncan result in permanent hearing loss.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nDarkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting \nT . pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are \nthe definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and \ncongenital syphilis (565). Although no T . pallidum direct-\ndetection molecular NAATs are commercially available, \ncertain laboratories provide locally developed and validated \nPCR tests for detecting T . pallidum DNA. A presumptive \ndiagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic \ntests: a nontreponemal test (i.e., Venereal Disease Research \nLaboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) \nand a treponemal test (i.e., the T . pallidum passive particle \nagglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, chemiluminescence \nimmunoassays [CIAs] and immunoblots, or rapid treponemal \nassays) (566–568). At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are \ncleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of \nserologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient \nfor diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among \npersons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results \namong persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis.\nNontreponemal Tests and Traditional Algorithm\nFalse-positive nontreponemal test results can be associated \nwith multiple medical conditions and factors unrelated to \nsyphilis, including other infections (e.g., HIV), autoimmune", "n_chars": 4595, "n_tokens_est": 1148, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.772091Z"}

Atypical nontreponemal serologic \ntest results (e.g., unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating \ntiters) might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic \ntests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of \nprimary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is \nrecommended for persons with risk factors for syphilis, and use \nof other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining \nand PCR of lesion) should be considered. For the majority \nof persons with HIV infection, serologic tests are accurate \nand reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response \nto treatment.\nTreponemal Tests and Reverse \nSequence Algorithm\nThe majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests \nwill have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless \nof adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% \nof patients treated during the primary stage revert to being \nserologically nonreactive after 2–3 years ( 570). T reponemal \nantibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore \nshould not be used for this purpose.\nClinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic \nsamples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, \ntypically by EIA or CIA ( 571–573). This reverse sequence \nalgorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously \ntreated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely \ntreated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can \noccur with a low likelihood of infection ( 574). Persons with \na positive treponemal screening test should have a standard \nquantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed \nreflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management \ndecisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory \nshould perform a treponemal test different from the one used \nfor initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based \non different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the \nresults of the initial test.\nIf a second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA reactive, \nRPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history \nof previous treatment will require no further management \nunless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a \nrepeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical \nhistory and physical examination is recommended to evaluate \nfor early infection. Those without a history of treatment for \nsyphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history \nor results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, \npreviously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of \nunknown duration or late latent syphilis.\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA reactive, \nRPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic \nrisk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further \nevaluation or treatment is not indicated.\nMultiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index \nvalues or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA \nor CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might \neliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; \nhowever, the range of index values varies among different \ntreponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to \nhigh levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ \nby immunoassay (567,575–582).\nCerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation\nFurther testing with CSF evaluation is warranted for \npersons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (e.g., cranial nerve \ndysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental \nstatus, or loss of vibration sense).

Among \npatients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive \nsyphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is \nunnecessary before treatment (583,584).\nLaboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of \nneurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose \nneurosyphilis in all instances. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis \ndepends on a combination of CSF tests (e.g., CSF cell count, \nprotein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive \nserologic test (nontreponemal and treponemal) results and \nneurologic signs and symptoms.

Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with \na negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among \npersons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms (587).\nAmong persons with HIV infection, CSF leukocyte count \ncan be elevated (>5 WBCs/mm\n3); the association with CSF \nleukocyte count and plasma HIV viral suppression has not been \nwell characterized. Using a higher cutoff (>20 WBCs/mm\n3) \nmight improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis among \nthis population (588).\nTreatment\nPenicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug \nfor treating patients in all stages of syphilis. The preparation \nused (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous \ncrystalline), dosage, and length of treatment depend on the \nstage and clinical manifestations of the disease. T reatment for \nlate latent syphilis (>1 years’ duration) and tertiary syphilis \nrequires a longer duration of therapy because organisms \ntheoretically might be dividing more slowly (the validity of this \nrationale has not been assessed). Longer treatment duration is \nrequired for persons with latent syphilis of unknown duration \nto ensure that those who did not acquire syphilis within the \npreceding year are adequately treated.\nSelection of the appropriate penicillin preparation is \nimportant because T . pallidum can reside in sequestered sites \n(e.g., the CNS and aqueous humor) that are poorly accessed \nby certain forms of penicillin. Combinations of benzathine \npenicillin, procaine penicillin, and oral penicillin preparations \nare not considered appropriate for syphilis treatment. Reports \nhave indicated that practitioners have inadvertently prescribed \ncombination long- and short-acting benzathine-procaine \npenicillin (Bicillin C-R) instead of the standard benzathine \npenicillin product (Bicillin L-A) recommended in the United \nStates for treating primary, secondary, and latent syphilis. \nPractitioners, pharmacists, and purchasing agents should be \naware of the similar names of these two products to avoid \nusing the incorrect combination therapy agent for treating \nsyphilis (589).\nPenicillin’s effectiveness for treating syphilis was well \nestablished through clinical experience even before the value of \nrandomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, \napproximately all recommendations for treating syphilis are \nbased not only on clinical trials and observational studies, but \non many decades of clinical experience.\nSpecial Considerations\nPregnancy\nParenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented \nefficacy for syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women with \nsyphilis at any stage who report penicillin allergy should be \ndesensitized and treated with penicillin (see Management of \nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\nJarisch-Herxheimer Reaction\nThe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction \nfrequently accompanied by headache, myalgia, and fever that \ncan occur within the first 24 hours after the initiation of any \nsyphilis therapy; it is a reaction to treatment and not an allergic \nreaction to penicillin. Patients should be informed about this \npossible adverse reaction and how to manage it if it occurs. The \nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among \npersons who have early syphilis, presumably because bacterial \nloads are higher during these stages. Antipyretics can be used \nto manage symptoms; however, they have not been proven to \nprevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction might \ninduce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women; \nhowever, this should not prevent or delay therapy ( 590) (see \nSyphilis During Pregnancy).\nManagement of Sex Partners\nSexual transmission of T . pallidum is thought to occur only", "n_chars": 4580, "n_tokens_est": 1145, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.772345Z"}

Persons who have latent syphilis and who \nacquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as \nhaving early latent syphilis (early nonprimary, nonsecondary). \nPersons can receive a diagnosis of early latent syphilis if, during \nthe year preceding the diagnosis, they had a documented \nseroconversion or a sustained (>2 weeks) fourfold or greater \nincrease in nontreponemal test titers in a previously treated \nperson; unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary \nsyphilis; or a sex partner documented to have primary, \nsecondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons \nwith reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only \npossible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, \nearly latent syphilis can be assumed.\nIn the absence of these conditions associated with latent \nsyphilis, an asymptomatic person should be considered to \nhave latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis \n(>1 year’s duration). Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are \nhigher early in the course of syphilis infection. However, early \nlatent syphilis cannot be reliably diagnosed solely on the basis \nof nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should \nhave careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces to \nevaluate for mucosal lesions (primary or secondary syphilis) \nbefore making a latent syphilis diagnosis. Physical examination \nshould include the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum, rectum, \nand genitals (vagina and cervix for women; scrotum, penis, and \nunderneath the foreskin for uncircumcised men).\nTreatment\nBecause latent syphilis is not transmitted sexually, the \nobjective of treating persons in this disease stage is to prevent \nmedical complications of syphilis. Latent syphilis can also be \nvertically transmitted to a fetus; therefore, the goal of treating \na pregnant woman is to prevent congenital syphilis. Although \nclinical experience supports the effectiveness of penicillin in \nachieving this goal, limited evidence is available for guiding \nchoice of specific regimens or duration. Available data \ndemonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, \namoxicillin, or other antibiotics in early latent syphilis do not \nenhance efficacy, regardless of HIV status (592,593,609).\nRecommended Regimens for Latent Syphilis* Among Adults\nEarly latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a \nsingle dose\nLate latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, \nadministered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals\n* Recommendations for treating syphilis in persons with HIV and pregnant \nwomen are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis Among \nPersons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).\nInfants and children aged ≥1 month with diagnosed latent \nsyphilis should be managed by a pediatric infectious disease \nspecialist and receive a CSF examination. In addition, birth \nand maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess \nwhether these infants and children have congenital or acquired \nsyphilis. For those with congenital syphilis, treatment should \nbe undertaken as described (see Congenital Syphilis). Those \nwith acquired syphilis should be evaluated for sexual abuse \n(e.g., through consultation with child protection services) (see \nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). These regimens are for \nchildren who are not allergic to penicillin who have acquired \nsyphilis and who have normal CSF examinations.\nOther Management Considerations\nAll persons who have latent syphilis should be tested for HIV \nat the time of diagnosis or treatment.

If clinical evidence of neurologic \ninvolvement is observed (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or \nsensory deficits, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of \nmeningitis or stroke), a CSF examination should be performed \nbefore treatment.\nSyphilitic uveitis or other ocular syphilis manifestations \n(e.g., neuroretinitis and optic neuritis) can occur at any stage \nof syphilis and can be isolated abnormalities or associated with \nneurosyphilis. All persons with ocular symptoms and reactive \nsyphilis serology need a full ocular examination, including \ncranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, \na CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular \nsymptoms (no cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic \nabnormalities), reactive syphilis serology, and confirmed ocular \nabnormalities on examination, CSF examination is unnecessary \nbefore treatment. CSF analysis might be helpful in evaluating \npersons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology \nwho do not have ocular findings on examination.

Therefore, repeated CSF examinations \nare unnecessary for persons without HIV infection or persons \nwith HIV infection who are on ART and who exhibit serologic \nand clinical responses after treatment.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\nSpecial Considerations\nPenicillin Allergy\nLimited data indicate that ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily either IM \nor IV for 10–14 days can be used as an alternative treatment \nfor persons with neurosyphilis (603,616,617). Cross-sensitivity \nbetween ceftriaxone and penicillin can occur; however, the \nrisk for penicillin cross-reactivity between third-generation \ncephalosporins is negligible ( 618–621) (see Management of \nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). If concern \nexists regarding ceftriaxone safety for a patient with neurosyphilis, \nskin testing should be performed to confirm penicillin allergy \nand, if necessary, penicillin desensitization in consultation with \na specialist is recommended. Other regimens have not been \nadequately evaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.\nPregnancy\nPregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be \ndesensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral \ngraded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying \nwomen at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of \nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\nHIV Infection\nPersons with HIV infection who have neurosyphilis should \nbe treated as described for persons without HIV (see Syphilis \nAmong Persons with HIV Infection).\nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection\nDiagnostic Considerations\nInterpretation of treponemal and nontreponemal serologic \ntests for persons with HIV infection is the same as for persons \nwithout HIV . Although rare, unusual serologic responses have \nbeen observed among persons with HIV infection who have \nsyphilis. The majority of reports have involved posttreatment \nserologic titers that were higher than expected (i.e., high serofast) \nor fluctuated, and false-negative serologic test results and delayed \nappearance of seroreactivity have also been reported (622).\nWhen clinical findings are indicative of syphilis, but serologic \ntests are nonreactive or their interpretation is unclear, alternative \ntests (e.g., biopsy of a lesion, darkfield examination, or PCR of \nlesion material) might be useful for diagnosis. Neurosyphilis, \nocular syphilis, and otosyphilis should be considered in the \ndifferential diagnosis of neurologic, ocular, and other signs \nand symptoms among persons with HIV infection.\nTreatment\nPersons with HIV infection who have early syphilis might \nbe at increased risk for neurologic complications ( 623) and \nmight have higher rates of inadequate serologic response \nwith recommended regimens. The magnitude of these risks is \nnot defined precisely but is likely small.

Serum RPR can be followed for necessary \ntreatment success rather than following CSF parameters (see \nNeurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).

Small observational studies \nconducted among persons with HIV and neurosyphilis report \nthat ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily for 10–14 days might be \neffective as an alternative agent ( 628–630). The possibility \nof cross-sensitivity between ceftriaxone and penicillin exists; \nhowever, the risk for penicillin cross-reactivity between \nthird-generation cephalosporins is negligible ( 619–621,631) \n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \nAllergy).

The risk for antepartum fetal infection or \ncongenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage \nduring pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during \nthe primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal \nnontreponemal titer, especially if >1:8, might be a marker of \nearly infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection \nis still substantial among pregnant women with late latent \nsyphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast \nlow nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated \nfor syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, \nincreasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman \npreviously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment \nfailure, and treatment should be offered.\nIf an automated treponemal test (e.g., EIA or CIA) is used for \nantepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed \nto a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g., RPR or VDRL). If \nthe nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered \ndiscrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) \nshould be performed, preferably on the same specimen.\nIf the second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA positive, \nRPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis \ninfection can be confirmed. For women with a history of \nadequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no \nfurther treatment is necessary. Women without a history of \ntreatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should \nbe treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA positive, \nRPR negative, or TP-PA negative), the positive EIA or CIA is \nmore likely to represent a false-positive test result for women \nwho are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have \na partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated \nsyphilis (637,638). If the woman is at low risk for syphilis, \nlacks signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, has a partner \nwith no clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis, and is likely \nto follow up with clinical care, repeat serologic testing within \n4 weeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA \nremains positive or if the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes \npositive. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further \ntreatment is necessary. If follow-up is not likely, women with an \nisolated reactive treponemal test and without a history of treated \nsyphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage.\nTreatment\nPenicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for \ntreating fetal infection and preventing congenital syphilis \n(639).

For women who have primary, secondary, or early \nlatent syphilis, a second dose of benzathine penicillin G \n2.4 million units IM can be administered 1 week after the \ninitial dose (641–643).\n• When syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of \npregnancy, management should include a sonographic fetal \nevaluation for congenital syphilis. However, this evaluation \nshould not delay therapy. Sonographic signs of fetal or \nplacental syphilis (e.g., hepatomegaly, ascites, hydrops, fetal \nanemia, or a thickened placenta) indicate a greater risk for \nfetal treatment failure (644); cases accompanied by these \nsigns should be managed in consultation with obstetric \nspecialists. A second dose of benzathine penicillin G \n2.4 million units IM after the initial dose might be beneficial \nfor fetal treatment in these situations.\n• Women treated for syphilis during the second half of \npregnancy are at risk for premature labor or fetal distress \nif the treatment precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer \nreaction (590). These women should be advised to seek \nobstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever, \ncontractions, or decrease in fetal movements.

Pregnant women who miss a \ndose of therapy should repeat the full course of therapy.\n• All women who have syphilis should be offered testing for \nHIV at the time of diagnosis.\nFollow-Up\nCoordinated prenatal care and treatment are vital because \nproviders should document that women are adequately \ntreated for the syphilis stage and ensure that the clinical and \nantibody responses are appropriate for the patient’s disease \nstage. If syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks’ \ngestation, serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks \nafter treatment (e.g., at 32 weeks’ gestation) but should be \nrepeated again at delivery. Titers should be repeated sooner \nif reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. For syphilis \ndiagnosed and treated after 24 weeks’ gestation, serologic titers \nshould be repeated at delivery.\nA majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease \nin titers before delivery, although this does not indicate \ntreatment failure (645). However, a fourfold increase in titer \nafter treatment (e.g., from 1:8 to 1:32) that is sustained for \n>2 weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure. \nNontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment, \npresumably related to the treatment response. Therefore, unless \nsymptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis, \nfollow-up titer should not be repeated until approximately \n8 weeks after treatment. Inadequate maternal treatment is \nlikely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, clinical signs \nof infection are present at delivery, or the maternal antibody \ntiter at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\nSpecial Considerations\nPenicillin Allergy\nNo proven alternatives to penicillin are available for \ntreatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women who \nhave a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and \ntreated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin \ndose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk \nfor acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who \nHave a History of Penicillin Allergy).\nT etracycline and doxycycline are to be avoided in the second \nand third trimesters of pregnancy (431). Erythromycin and \nazithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures \nmaternal infection nor treats an infected fetus (640). Data are \ninsufficient to recommend ceftriaxone or other cephalosporins \nfor treatment of maternal infection and prevention of \ncongenital syphilis (646,647).\nHIV Infection\nPlacental inflammation from congenital syphilis infection \nmight increase the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV . All \nwomen with HIV infection should be evaluated for syphilis and \nreceive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage. \nData are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens \nfor pregnant women with syphilis and HIV infection (see \nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV).\nCongenital Syphilis\nThe rate of reported congenital syphilis in the United States \nhas increased dramatically since 2012. During 2019, a total of \n1,870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported, including 94 \nstillbirths and 34 infant deaths (141). The 2019 national rate \nof 48.5 cases per 100,000 live births represents a 41% increase \nrelative to 2018 (34.3 cases per 100,000 live births) and a 477% \nincrease relative to 2012 (8.4 cases per 100,000 live births). \nDuring 2015–2019, the rate of congenital syphilis increased \n291.1% (12.4 to 48.5 per 100,000 live births), which mirrors \nincreases in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis among \nfemales aged 15–44 years (a 171.9% increase, from 3.2 to 8.7 \nper 100,000 females).", "n_chars": 4586, "n_tokens_est": 1146, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.773508Z"}

Any woman who had no prenatal care before \ndelivery or is considered at increased risk for syphilis acquisition \nduring pregnancy should have the results of a syphilis serologic \ntest documented before she or her neonate is discharged. A \nquantitative RPR is needed at the time of delivery to compare \nwith the neonate’s nontreponemal test result. If a stat RPR \nis unavailable and a rapid treponemal test is performed at \ndelivery, the results should be confirmed by using standard \nsyphilis serologic laboratory tests (e.g., RPR and treponemal \ntest) and algorithms.\nEvaluation and Treatment of Neonates\nDiagnosis of congenital syphilis can be difficult because \nmaternal nontreponemal and treponemal immunoglobulin G \n(IgG) antibodies can be transferred through the placenta to the \nfetus, complicating the interpretation of reactive serologic tests \nfor syphilis among neonates (infants aged <30 days). Therefore, \ntreatment decisions frequently must be made on the basis of \nidentification of syphilis in the mother; adequacy of maternal \ntreatment; presence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic \nevidence of syphilis in the neonate; and comparison of maternal \n(at delivery) and neonatal nontreponemal serologic titers (e.g., \nRPR or VDRL) by using the same test, preferably conducted \nby the same laboratory. Any neonate at risk for congenital \nsyphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for HIV .\nAll neonates born to mothers who have reactive nontreponemal \nand treponemal test results should be evaluated with a \nquantitative nontreponemal serologic test (RPR or VDRL) \nperformed on the neonate’s serum because umbilical cord blood \ncan become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a \nfalse-positive result, and Wharton’s jelly within the umbilical \ncord can yield a false-negative result. The nontreponemal \ntest performed on the neonate should be the same type of \nnontreponemal test performed on the mother.\nConducting a treponemal test (e.g., TP-PA, immunoassay-\nEIA, CIA, or microbead immunoassay) on neonatal serum is \nnot recommended because it is difficult to interpret, as passively \ntransferred maternal antibodies can persist for >15 months. \nCommercially available IgM tests are not recommended.\nAll neonates born to women who have reactive nontreponemal \nserologic tests for syphilis at delivery should be examined \nthoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis (e.g., nonimmune \nhydrops, conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia\n† or \ncholestatic jaundice or cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, \nrhinitis, skin rash, or pseudoparalysis of an extremity). \nPathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using \nspecific staining (e.g., silver) or a T . pallidum PCR test using \n† Direct hyperbilirubinemia is direct bilirubin level >2 mg/dL (34 umol/L) or \n20% of the total bilirubin level.\na CLIA-validated test should be considered; direct fluorescence \nantibody (DFA-TP) reagents are unavailable (565).

Penicillin is recommended for all \nclinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for \ntreating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during \npregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is \nrecommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site \ninfections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone\nRecommendations and Reports\nMMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4 57\nUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nregimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients \nwho report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam \nantimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and \na concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often \navoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin \nallergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low (652–654).\nPrevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately \n10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital \ninpatients and residents in health care–related facilities (655–\n658). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of \npatients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic \nallergy (659). Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the \nmajority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate \nthe medication (660). The prevalence of reported penicillin \nallergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited \ndata indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently \nreported antibiotic allergies (661).\nPatients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin \nand are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. \nThe presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces \nprescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin \nallergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective \ndrugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer \nlength of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple \nstudies have described that persons with reported penicillin or \nanother ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-\nsite infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \ninfections, and higher medical care usage (653,662–664).\nThe overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is \nsecondary to imprecise use of the term “allergy” by families \nand clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between \nimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, \ndrug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can \noccur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients \nwith a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have \nlost the sensitivity after 10 years ( 658). Thus, patients with \nrecent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients \nwith remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions \nin the distant past might no longer be reactive.\nIn a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.1% of \nthe patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another \nß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin \nallergy (659). Moreover, in studies that have incorporated \npenicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons \nwith reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, \nranging from 1.5% to 6.1% (665–667). Studies in preoperative \nsurgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated \nfor cardiovascular surgery (668) or orthopedics (669), have \nrates of skin test positivity <8.5%. However, when patients \nwith high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, 99% \nof patients could receive ß-lactams. In hospitalized patients \nand other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of \nvalidated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history \nof penicillin allergy are 2.5%–9.0% (670–673).\nCross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins\nPenicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. \nThis structural similarity has led to considerable confusion \nregarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for \nallergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-\nallergic patients.

Until recently, penicillin skin testing in the \nUnited States only included the major determinant benzyl \npenicillin poly-L-lysine (Pre-Pen) in addition to penicillin G. \nThis test identifies approximately 90%–99% of the IgE-\nmediated penicillin-allergic patients. Because the remaining \n1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured \nby this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE \nantibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with \nan observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour \nof observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both \nnegative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero \nand is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported \nan allergy to penicillin.\nA revised version of the penicillin skin test kit, which includes \nthe major determinant reagent Pre-Pen, minor determinants, \nand amoxicillin, is being evaluated by FDA. This penicillin \nskin test kit has been evaluated among 455 patients ( 677) \nwith previous allergy history and has a negative predictive \nvalue of 98%. If approved, this kit might eliminate the need \nfor oral challenge.\nPenicillin skin testing has become a clinically significant \nelement in antibiotic stewardship programs, and the \nprocedure has been increasingly used by hospital-based \npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \n(670,672,673,678,679) as part of overall antibiotic stewardship \ninterventions. When integrated into stewardship, the rates of \nß-lactam antibiotic use increased substantially (670).\nRecommendations\nPersons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous \nreaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., \ninterstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates \nfor penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any \nother ß-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely \namong these patients, who should be referred to an allergy \ncenter for further evaluation. Similarly, patients who deny \npenicillin allergy, but who report previous IgE-type reactions \nto cephalosporins, should be referred to an allergist for specific \ncephalosporin testing.\nIn a time of increasing antimicrobial resistance, following \nrecommended use of antibiotic treatments is crucial. STI \nprograms and clinicians should promote increased access to \npenicillin allergy testing. Allergy testing is being provided \nby clinicians in primary care and hospital settings. If \nappropriate, STI programs and ambulatory settings should \nconsider developing expanded access to penicillin or ß-lactam \nallergy assessment.\nPersons with high-risk symptom histories (e.g., anaphylaxis \nwithin the previous 10 years) should not be administered \npenicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. \nFurthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should \nnot receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge \nin an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an \nallergist for further evaluation.\nHigh-risk symptom histories include development of \nthe following after penicillin or ß-lactam administration: \nanaphylaxis within 6 hours or severe adverse cutaneous reaction \n(e.g., eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or acute generalized", "n_chars": 4580, "n_tokens_est": 1145, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.774373Z"}

If the reaction \noccurred in the distant past (>10 years), the likelihood is \nreduced even further ( 653,658,663,682,683,685,686). The \nrisk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased \nover time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–\n2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was \nreported (684).\n Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy\nSkin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if \nany indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an \nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity. T esting is also indicated as a \npotential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin \nallergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical \nrecord (i.e., delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing \ndoes not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with \na negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to \nconfirm the negative status.\nPersons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by \nan amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin \ntherapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and \nfor whom no other clinical options exist (e.g., neurosyphilis and \nsyphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist \nand desensitized before initiating treatment.\nTesting Procedures\nPenicillin skin testing includes use of skin test reagents for \nidentifying persons at risk for adverse reactions (Box 3), followed \nby initial pinprick screening with penicillin major determinants \n(Pre-Pen) and penicillin G, followed by intradermal testing if \npinprick results are negative. Penicillin testing procedures are \nperformed in accordance with the Pre-Pen test kit instructions \n(https://penallergytest.com/wp-content/uploads/PRE-PEN-\nPackage-Insert.pdf). Saline negative controls and histamine \npositive controls are an integral part of the procedure. Penicillin \nskin testing should not be performed for patients who have \ntaken antihistamines within the past 7 days.\nSkin testing can be safely performed by trained \nnonallergists and has been implemented as an antimicrobial \nstewardship intervention by internal medicine physicians, \npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \n(670,673,678,679). Patients tested should also receive \ndocumentation of status, and the results should be entered in \nthe medical record.\nPenicillin skin testing during pregnancy is considered safe. \nFor pregnant persons who report a penicillin or ß-lactam \nallergy, penicillin allergy is an important consideration in \ntreating syphilis during pregnancy and the potential for group \nB streptococcal infection and preoperative prophylaxis if a \ncesarean delivery is required. However, oral challenges should \nnot be performed unless in a setting where additional support \nservices are available.\nManaging Persons Being Tested\nPatients who have a positive skin test should not receive \nß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be \nreferred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further \nevaluation.

Signs of urethral \ndischarge on examination can also be present among persons \nwithout symptoms. Although N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis \nare well established as clinically important infectious causes of \nurethritis, M. genitalium has been strongly associated with \nurethritis and, less commonly, prostatitis (691–697). If POC \ndiagnostic tools (e.g., Gram, methylene blue [MB], or gentian \nviolet [GV] stain microscopy) are unavailable, drug regimens \neffective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia should be \nadministered. Further testing to determine the specific etiology \nis recommended for preventing complications, reinfection, \nand transmission because a specific diagnosis might improve \ntreatment compliance, delivery of risk-reduction interventions, \nand partner services. Both chlamydia and gonorrhea are \nreportable to health departments. NAATs are preferred for \ndetecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and urine is the \npreferred specimen for males ( 553). NAAT-based tests for \ndiagnosing T . vaginalis among men with urethritis have not \nbeen cleared by FDA; however, laboratories have performed \nthe CLIA-compliant validation studies (698) needed to provide \nsuch testing.\nEtiology\nMultiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The \npresence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) \nor purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral \nsmear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, \nwhich is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. \nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when \nmicroscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation \nwithout GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, \nis caused by C. trachomatis in 15%–40% of cases; however, \nprevalence varies by age group, with a lower proportion of \ndisease occurring among older men (699). Documentation of \nchlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the \nneed for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent \ncomplications of chlamydia, especially for female partners. \nComplications of C. trachomatis –associated NGU among \nmales include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis.\nM. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and \nurethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU \ncases in the United States ( 691–693,696,697,700). Among \nmen with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected \nin 11% of those with urethritis in Australia (701), 12%–15% \nin the United Kingdom (702–704), 15% in South Africa (696), \n19% in China (705), 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan (706), and \n28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%) (697).

In a retrospective review of 80 cases of HSV \nurethritis in Australia ( 717), the majority of infections were \nassociated with HSV-1 with clinical findings of meatitis (62%), \ngenital ulceration (37%), and dysuria (20%). Adenovirus can \npresent with dysuria, meatal inflammation, and conjunctivitis \n(718). Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon \ncause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal \nintercourse (699).\nOther bacterial pathogens have been implicated as potential \ncauses of clinical urethritis, either in clustered case series or as \nsporadic cases such as Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus \nparainfluenzae (719–723). Haemophilus was identified in 12.6% \nof cases among 413 men (mostly MSM reporting insertive oral \nsex) (724), and high rates of azithromycin resistance (39.5%) \nwere identified among Haemophilus urethritis patients (725). \nIndividual case reports have linked NGU to multiple bacterial \nspecies, including Corynebacterium propinquum (726), Kurthia \ngibsonii (727), Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum (728,729), \nCorynebacterium striatrium ( 730), Aerococcus urinae ( 731), \nand Neisseria elongata (732). Diagnostic testing and treatment \nfor less-common organisms are reserved for situations in \nwhich these infections are suspected (e.g., sexual partner with \ntrichomoniasis, urethral lesions, or severe dysuria and meatitis) \nor when NGU is not responsive to recommended therapy.\nEven in settings that provide comprehensive diagnostic \ntesting, etiology can remain obscure in half of cases. Idiopathic \nNGU was reported in 772 (59%) of 1,295 first presentations \nof NGU among men seeking sexual health services in Australia \n(701). In a case-control study of 211 men with NGU \nsymptoms in Denmark, no identifiable pathogen was identified \nin 24% of acute cases and 33% of chronic cases (733). NGU’s \nimportance if not caused by a defined pathogen is uncertain; \nneither complications (e.g., urethral stricture or epididymitis) \nnor adverse outcomes among sex partners have been identified \nin these cases.\nAssociations between NGU and insertive anal and oral \nexposure have been reported ( 734), as have higher rates \nof BV-associated Leptotrichia or Sneathia species among \nheterosexual men with urethritis (735). These studies increase \nconcern for possible undetected infectious rectal or vaginal \npathogens, or alternatively, a transient reactive dysbiosis after \nexposure to a new microbiome or even a noninfectious reactive \netiology (736).\nDiagnostic Considerations\nClinicians should attempt to obtain objective evidence of \nurethral inflammation. If POC diagnostic tests (e.g., Gram \nstain or MB or GV microscopy) are unavailable, urethritis \ncan be documented on the basis of any of the following signs \nor laboratory tests:\n• Mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge on examination.\n• Gram stain is a POC diagnostic test for evaluating \nurethritis that is highly sensitive and specific for \ndocumenting both urethritis and the presence or absence \nof gonococcal infection; MB or GV stain of urethral \nsecretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test with \nperformance characteristics similar to Gram stain; thus, \nthe cutoff number for WBCs per oil immersion field \nshould be the same (737).\n ű Presumed gonococcal infection is established by \ndocumenting the presence of WBCs containing GNID \nin Gram stain or intracellular purple diplococci in MB \nor GV smears; men should be tested for C. trachomatis \nand N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and presumptively treated \nand managed accordingly for gonococcal infection (see", "n_chars": 4594, "n_tokens_est": 1148, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.774749Z"}

Persons \nwith chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended \ntreatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation \nand treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, \nempiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is \nrecommended only for those at high risk for infection who are \nunlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such \nmen should be treated with drug regimens effective against \ngonorrhea and chlamydia.\nNongonococcal Urethritis\nNGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various \ninfectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established \nas an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across \npopulations and accounts for <50% of overall cases (712,740–\n742). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of \ncases (696,697,701,703,704,706,733,743), and T . vaginalis \nfor 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location \n(703,706,708,710,712). Other etiologies include different \nbacteria, such as Haemophilus species (724,725), N. meningitidis \n(713,716), HSV (706,717), and adenovirus (744). However, \neven when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are \nidentified in approximately half of cases (701,733).\nDiagnostic Considerations\nClinical presentation can include urethral discharge, \nirritation, dysuria, or meatal pruritus (697,743,745). NGU is \nconfirmed for symptomatic men when diagnostic evaluation of \nurethral secretions indicates inflammation, without evidence \nof diplococci by Gram, MB, or GV smear on microscopy \n(712,746,747). Visible discharge or secretions can be collected \nby a swab without inserting it into the urethra; if no visible \nsecretions, the swab can be inserted into the urethral meatus \nand rotated, making contact with the urethral wall before \nremoval. If microscopy is unavailable, urine testing for \nleukocyte esterase can be performed on first-void urine, and \nmicroscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void \nurine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF has a high negative \npredictive value.\nAll men who have suspected or confirmed NGU should \nbe tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea by using NAATs. \nA specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, \nreinfection, and transmission. M. genitalium\n testing should be \nperformed for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms \nafter initial empiric treatment.

Men with NGU should \nbe tested for HIV and syphilis.\nFollow-Up\nMen should be provided their testing results obtained as \npart of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis \nof chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be \noffered partner services and instructed to return 3 months \nafter treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of \nreinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated \n(136,137,753,754) (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal \nInfections; T richomoniasis).\nIf symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men \nshould be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be \ntested for M. genitalium and T . vaginalis. Symptoms alone, \nwithout documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of \nurethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. \nProviders should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic \nprostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing \npersistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; \nvoiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-\nonset premature ejaculation lasting for >3 months. Men with \npersistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise \nin pelvic pain disorders.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nAll sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding \n60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and \npresumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against \nchlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated \naccording to the management section for their respective \npathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is \nunable to access timely care. T o avoid reinfection, sex partners \nshould abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their \npartners are treated.\nPersistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis\nThe objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU \nshould be made before considering additional antimicrobial \ntherapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might \nbe caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful \ntreatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after \ntreatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the \nvalue of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been \ndemonstrated. T reatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has \nbeen estimated at 6%–12% (755). The most common cause \nof persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially \nafter doxycycline therapy ( 756,757). T reatment failure for \nM. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men \nachieve clinical cure (i.e., resolution of symptoms) but can \nstill have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens (758).\nThe initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance \nwith treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex \npartner (697, 743). If the patient did not comply with the \ntreatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, \nretreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If \ntherapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure \noccurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment \nregimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent \nor persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, \nchlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to \nguide further management decisions.\nT . vaginalis is also known to cause urethritis among men who \nhave sex with women.

T reatment \nfor M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach, ideally using \nresistance-guided therapy.

Either or both \nsigns might be present. Cervicitis frequently is asymptomatic; \nhowever, certain women might report an abnormal vaginal \ndischarge and intermenstrual vaginal bleeding (e.g., especially \nafter sexual intercourse). The criterion of using an increased \nnumber of WBCs on endocervical Gram stain in the diagnosis \nof cervicitis has not been standardized; it is not sensitive, \nhas a low positive predictive value for C. trachomatis and \nN. gonorrhoeae infections, and is not available in most clinical \nsettings (297,761). Leukorrhea, defined as >10 WBCs/HPF on \nmicroscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive \nindicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative \npredictive value (i.e., cervicitis is unlikely in the absence of \nleukorrhea) (762,763). Finally, although the presence of gram-\nnegative intracellular diplococci on Gram stain of endocervical \nexudate might be specific for diagnosing gonococcal cervical \ninfection when evaluated by an experienced laboratorian, it is \nnot a sensitive indicator of infection (764).\nEtiology\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology \nof cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. T richomoniasis, \ngenital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or \nM. genitalium ( 761,765–768) also have been associated \nwith cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no \norganism is isolated, especially among women at relatively \nlow risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g., women aged \n>30 years) (769). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent \ndouching might cause cervicitis (770– 772). The majority \nof persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection \nwith C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might \nbe involved (e.g., persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, \nM. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical \nirritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of \nectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between \ngroup B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis ( 773,774). \nNo specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or \nUreaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis (707,761,765,775,776).\nDiagnostic Considerations\nBecause cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract \ninfection (e.g., endometritis), women should be assessed for \nsigns of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae \nwith NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples ( 553) (see \nChlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women \nwith cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV \nand trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for \ndetecting T . vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), \nsymptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount \nmicroscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing \n(i.e., NAAT , culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) \n(see T richomoniasis). T esting for M. genitalium with the FDA-\ncleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection \nhas been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing \n(i.e., PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. T esting for \nU. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis , or genital \nculture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.\nTreatment\nMultiple factors should affect the decision to provide \npresumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with \nantimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should \nbe provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged \n<25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner \nwith concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if \nfollow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not \npossible.

Women with a specific diagnosis of \nchlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered \npartner services and instructed to return in 3 months after \ntreatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, \nregardless of whether their sex partners were treated (753). If \nsymptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to \nreturn for reevaluation.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nManagement of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis \nshould be tailored for the specific infection identified or \nsuspected. All sex partners during the previous 60 days should \nbe referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment \nif chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified. EPT \nand other effective partner referral strategies are alternative \napproaches for treating male partners of women who have \nchlamydial or gonococcal infection ( 125–127) (see Partner \nServices). T o avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain \nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.\nPersistent or Recurrent Cervicitis\nWomen with persistent or recurrent cervicitis despite \nantimicrobial therapy should be reevaluated for possible \nreexposure or treatment failure. If relapse or reinfection with \na specific infection has been excluded, BV is not present, and \nsex partners have been evaluated and treated, management \noptions for persistent cervicitis are undefined. In addition, \nthe usefulness of repeated or prolonged administration of \nantimicrobial therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis \nremains unknown. The etiology of persistent cervicitis, \nincluding the potential role of M. genitalium (777), is unclear. \nM. genitalium might be considered for cases of cervicitis that \npersist after azithromycin or doxycycline therapy in which \nreexposure to an infected partner or medical nonadherence is \nunlikely. Among women with persistent cervicitis who were \npreviously treated with doxycycline or azithromycin, testing \nfor M. genitalium can be considered and treatment initiated on \nthe basis of results of diagnostic testing (318) (see Mycoplasma \ngenitalium). For women with persistent symptoms that are \nclearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic \nspecialist can be considered for evaluation of noninfectious \ncauses (e.g., cervical dysplasia or polyps) (778).\nSpecial Considerations\nHIV Infection\nWomen with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive \nthe same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV . \nCervicitis can increase cervical HIV shedding, and treatment \nreduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might \nreduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners (779–783).\nPregnancy\nDiagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women \ndoes not differ from that for women who are not pregnant (see \nDiagnostic Considerations; T reatment).\nContraceptive Management\nAccording to U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive \nUse, 2016, leaving an IUD in place during treatment for \ncervicitis is advisable (58).

More frequent screening than annual for \ncertain women (e.g., adolescents) or certain men (e.g., MSM) \nmight be indicated on the basis of risk behaviors.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nFor women, C. trachomatis urogenital infection can be \ndiagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or first-void urine. For \nmen, C. trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by \ntesting first-void urine or a urethral swab. NAATs are the most \nsensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended \ntest for detecting C. trachomatis infection (553). NAATs that \nare FDA cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be \ncollected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting. Patient-\ncollected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity \nand specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs \n(792,793), and this screening strategy is highly acceptable \namong women ( 794,795). Optimal urogenital specimen \ntypes for chlamydia screening by using NAAT include first-\ncatch urine (for men) and vaginal swabs (for women) (553). \nRecent studies have demonstrated that among men, NAAT \nperformance on self-collected meatal swabs is comparable \nto patient-collected urine or provider-collected urethral \nswabs ( 796–798). Patient collection of a meatal swab for \nC. trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men \nwho are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their \nown meatal swab over providing urine. Previous evidence \nindicates that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for \nPap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT , although \ntest sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that \nassociated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens (799); \nregardless, certain NAATs have been cleared by FDA for use \non liquid-based cytology specimens.\nRectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection among \npersons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be \ndiagnosed by testing at the anatomic exposure site. NAATs \nhave been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and \nspecificity, compared with culture, for detecting C. trachomatis \nat rectal and oropharyngeal sites (553,800–804), and certain \nNAAT platforms have been cleared by FDA for these \nanatomic sites (805). Data indicate that NAAT performance \non self-collected rectal swabs is comparable to clinician-\ncollected rectal swabs, and this specimen collection strategy \nfor rectal C. trachomatis screening is highly acceptable among \nmen (217,806). Self-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable \nalternative to clinician-collected rectal swabs for C. trachomatis \nscreening by NAAT , especially when clinicians are not available \nor when self-collection is preferred over clinician collection. \nAnnual screening for rectal C. trachomatis infection should \nbe performed among men who report sexual activity at the \nrectal site. Extragenital chlamydial testing at the rectal site \ncan be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual \nbehaviors and exposure through shared clinical decision-\nmaking by the patient and the provider. The majority of \npersons with C. trachomatis detected at oropharyngeal sites do \nnot have oropharyngeal symptoms. The clinical significance of \noropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection is unclear, and prevalence \nis low, even among populations at high risk.

A randomized trial \nfor the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among MSM \nreported microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and \n74% with azithromycin (812). A published review reported \nthat C. trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among \n33%–83% of women who had urogenital C. trachomatis \ninfection, and its detection was not associated with report of \nreceptive anorectal sexual activity (813).\nAlthough the clinical significance of oropharyngeal \nC. trachomatis infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal \nscreening is not recommended, oropharyngeal C. trachomatis \ncan be sexually transmitted to genital sites (211,814); therefore, \nif C. trachomatis is identified from an oropharyngeal specimen \nwhile screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated. \nEvidence is limited regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial \nregimens for oropharyngeal chlamydia; however, a recently \npublished observational study indicates doxycycline might \nbe more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal \nchlamydia (815).\nAvailable evidence supports that doxycycline is efficacious \nfor C. trachomatis infections of urogenital, rectal, and \noropharyngeal sites. Although azithromycin maintains high \nefficacy for urogenital C. trachomatis infection among women, \nconcern exists regarding effectiveness of azithromycin for \nconcomitant rectal C. trachomatis infection, which can occur \ncommonly among women and cannot be predicted by reported \nsexual activity. Inadequately treated rectal C. trachomatis \ninfection among women who have urogenital chlamydia \ncan increase the risk for transmission and place women at \nrisk for repeat urogenital C. trachomatis infection through \nautoinoculation from the anorectal site (816). Doxycycline is \nalso available in a delayed-release 200-mg tablet formulation, \nwhich requires once-daily dosing for 7 days and is as effective \nas doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treating \nurogenital C. trachomatis infection in men and women. It is \nmore costly but also has lower frequency of gastrointestinal \nside effects ( 817). Levofloxacin is an effective treatment \nalternative but is more expensive. Erythromycin is no longer \nrecommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side \neffects, which can result in nonadherence. When nonadherence \nto doxycycline regimen is a substantial concern, azithromycin \n1 g regimen is an alternative treatment option but might \nrequire posttreatment evaluation and testing because it has \ndemonstrated lower treatment efficacy among persons with \nrectal infection.\nAmong persons receiving multidose regimens, medication \nshould be dispensed with all doses involved, on-site and in \nthe clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed.

Compared with standard patient \nreferral of partners, this approach to therapy, which involves \ndelivering the medication itself or a prescription by the \npatient or collaborating pharmacy, has been associated with \ndecreased rates of persistent or recurrent chlamydia among \nwomen ( 125–127). Providers should provide patients with \nwritten educational materials to give to their partners about \nchlamydia, which should include notification that partners \nhave been exposed and information about the importance \nof treatment. These materials also should inform partners \nabout potential therapy-related allergies and adverse effects, \nalong with symptoms indicative of complications (e.g., \ntesticular pain among men and pelvic or abdominal pain \namong women).

Therefore, follow-up of infants is recommended to \ndetermine whether the initial treatment was effective. The \npossibility of concomitant chlamydial pneumonia should be \nconsidered (see Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis).\nManagement of Mothers and Their Sex Partners\nMothers of infants who have ophthalmia caused by chlamydia \nand the sex partners of these women should be evaluated and \npresumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection \nAmong Adolescents and Adults).\nInfant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis\nChlamydial pneumonia among infants typically occurs at age \n1–3 months and is a subacute pneumonia. Characteristic signs \nof chlamydial pneumonia among infants include a repetitive \nstaccato cough with tachypnea and hyperinflation and bilateral \ndiffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. In addition, peripheral \neosinophilia (≥400 cells/mm\n3) occurs frequently. Because \nclinical presentations differ, all infants aged 1–3 months \nsuspected of having pneumonia, especially those whose \nmothers have a history of, are at risk for (e.g., aged <25 years \nand those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more \nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \nor a sex partner who has an STI), or suspected of having a \nchlamydial infection should be tested for C. trachomatis and \ntreated if infected.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nSpecimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from \nthe nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard \ndiagnostic test for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture \ntests (e.g., DFA and NAAT) can be used. DFA is the only \nnonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting C. trachomatis from \nnasopharyngeal specimens; however, DFA of nasopharyngeal \nspecimens has a lower sensitivity and specificity than culture. \nNAATs are not cleared by FDA for detecting chlamydia from \nnasopharyngeal specimens, and clinical laboratories should \nverify the procedure according to CLIA regulations ( 553). \nT racheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, \nshould be tested for C. trachomatis.\nTreatment\nBecause test results for chlamydia often are unavailable at the \ntime initial treatment decisions are being made, treatment for \nC. trachomatis pneumonia frequently is based on clinical and \nradiologic findings, age of the infant (i.e., 1–3 months), and \nrisk for chlamydia in the mother (i.e., aged <25 years, history \nof chlamydial infection, multiple sex partners, a sex partner \nwith a concurrent partner, or a sex partner with a history of \nan STI). In the absence of laboratory results in a situation \nwith a high degree of suspicion of chlamydial infection and \nthe mother is unlikely to return with the infant for follow-up, \nexposed infants can be presumptively treated with the shorter-\ncourse regimen of azithromycin 20 mg/kg body weight/day \norally, 1 dose daily for 3 days.\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Pneumonia Among \nInfants\nErythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg body weight/day orally \ndivided into 4 doses daily for 14 days\nAlternative Regimen\nAzithromycin suspension 20 mg/kg body weight/day orally, 1 dose \ndaily for 3 days\nFollow-Up\nBecause erythromycin effectiveness in treating pneumonia \ncaused by C. trachomatis is approximately 80%, a second \ncourse of therapy might be required ( 836).

Urethral infections caused by \nN. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause \nthem to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent \nsequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission \nto others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly \nasymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms \nuntil complications (e.g., PID) have occurred. PID can result in \ntubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.\nAnnual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended \nfor all sexually active women aged <25 years and for older \nwomen at increased risk for infection (e.g., those aged ≥25 years \nwho have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex \npartner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has \nan STI) (149). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include \ninconsistent condom use among persons who are not in \nmutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting \nSTIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians \nshould consider the communities they serve and consult local \npublic health authorities for guidance regarding identifying \ngroups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is \nconcentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. \nMSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g., those with \nmultiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at \nrisk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic \nsites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex \nwith Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all \nMSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and \nwomen aged >25 years who are at low risk for infection is \nnot recommended (149). A recent travel history with sexual \ncontacts outside the United States should be part of any \ngonorrhea evaluation.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nSpecific microbiologic diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection \nshould be performed for all persons at risk for or suspected of \nhaving gonorrhea; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce \ncomplications, reinfections, and transmission. Culture, NAAT , \nand POC NAAT , such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), are available \nfor detecting genitourinary infection with N. gonorrhoeae \n(149); culture requires endocervical (women) or urethral \n(men) swab specimens.

Nonnutritive swab transport \nsystems are available that might maintain gonococcal viability \nfor <48 hours in ambient temperatures (843–845).\nBecause of its high specificity (>99%) and sensitivity \n(>95%), a Gram stain of urethral discharge or secretions that \ndemonstrate polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular \ngram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for \ninfection with N. gonorrhoeae among symptomatic men. \nHowever, because of lower sensitivity, a negative Gram stain \nshould not be considered sufficient for ruling out infection \namong asymptomatic men. Infection detection by using \nGram stain of endocervical, pharyngeal, and rectal specimens \nalso is insensitive and is not recommended. MB or GV stain \nof urethral secretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test \nwith performance characteristics similar to Gram stain. \nGonococcal infection is diagnosed among symptomatic men by \ndocumenting the presence of a WBC-containing intracellular \npurple diplococci in MB or GV smears.\nAntimicrobial-Resistant N. gonorrhoeae\nGonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of \nN. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials \n(846–848). In 1986, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance \nProject (GISP), a national sentinel surveillance system, was \nestablished to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities \nof urethral N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States \n(849). The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides \ndecisions about gonococcal treatment recommendations \nand has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial resistance \npatterns. During 2007, emergence of fluoroquinolone-\nresistant N. gonorrhoeae in the United States prompted CDC \nto cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea \ntreatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining \nclass of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in \nthe United States (850). Reflecting concern about emerging \ngonococcal resistance, CDC’s 2010 STD treatment guidelines \nrecommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin \nplus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for \nC. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment ( 851). \nHowever, during 2006–2011, the minimum concentrations of \ncefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the N. gonorrhoeae \nstrains circulating in the United States and other countries \nincreased, demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be \nwaning (851). In addition, treatment failures with cefixime or \nother oral cephalosporins were reported in Asia ( 852–855), \nEurope (856–860), South Africa (861), and Canada (862,863). \nDuring that time, case reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures \nfor pharyngeal infections reported in Australia ( 864,865), \nJapan ( 866 ), and Europe were concerning ( 856 ,867 ). \nConsequently, CDC no longer recommends cefixime as a \nfirst-line regimen for gonorrhea treatment in the United \nStates ( 868).

However, isolates with cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs \n≥0.5 µg/mL are considered to have decreased susceptibility \n(873). In the United States, the proportion of isolates in \nGISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone \nor cefixime has remained low; during 2019, <0.1% of isolates \nwith decreased susceptibility (MIC ≥0.5 µg/mL) to ceftriaxone \nor cefixime were identified (141). Because increasing MICs \nmight predict resistance emergence, GISP established lower \ncephalosporin MIC threshold values that are lower than the \nsusceptibility breakpoints set by CLSI to provide greater \nsensitivity in detecting decreasing gonococcal susceptibility \nfor surveillance purposes. The percentage of isolates with \ncefixime MICs ≥0.25 µg/mL increased from 0.1% during \n2006 to 1.4% during 2011 ( 851,874) and declined to 0.3% \nduring 2019 (141).

Although \napproximately 3% of all U.S. men who have gonococcal \ninfections are sampled through GISP , surveillance by clinicians \nalso is crucial. Clinicians who diagnose N. gonorrhoeae infection \nin a person with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure \nshould perform culture and AST of relevant clinical specimens, \nconsult an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical \nexpert ( https://www.stdccn.org/render/Public) for guidance \nin clinical management, and report the case to CDC through \nstate and local public health authorities within 24 hours. \nIsolates should be saved and sent to CDC through local and \nstate public health laboratory mechanisms. Health departments \nshould prioritize notification and culture evaluation for sexual \npartners of persons with N. gonorrhoeae infection thought \nto be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or \npersons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility \nto cephalosporin.

The increase in the prevalence of isolates obtained \nthrough GISP with elevated cefixime MICs might indicate \nearly stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal \nresistance to cephalosporins. Changes in cefixime MICs can \nresult in decreasing effectiveness of cefixime for treating \nurogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes \nless effective, continued used of cefixime might hasten the \ndevelopment of resistance to ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, \ninjectable cephalosporin and the last antimicrobial known to \nbe highly effective in a single dose for treatment of gonorrhea \nat all anatomic infection sites.

Any \nperson with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days \nafter initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or \nNAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased \nlikelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort \nshould be made to perform a confirmatory culture before \nretreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All \npositive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment \nshould be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or \nwithout simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. \nPersistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused \nby other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).\nA high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been \nobserved among men and women previously treated for \ngonorrhea (137,753,754,893). The majority of these infections \nresult from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to \nreceive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a \nnew infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient \neducation and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who \nhave been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months \nafter treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex \npartners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the \ntime of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not \npossible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek \nmedical care <12 months after initial treatment.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nRecent sex partners (i.e., persons having sexual contact with \nthe infected patient <60 days preceding onset of symptoms or \ngonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, \nand presumptive treatment. If the patient’s last potential sexual \nexposure was >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, \nthe most recent sex partner should be treated.\nIf health department partner-management strategies (e.g., \ndisease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable \nfor persons with gonorrhea and partners’ access to prompt \nclinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be \ndelivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating \npharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). T reatment \nof the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose \nis recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial \ninfection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not \nbeen documented, the partner may be treated with a single \ndose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg \n2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is \na considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered \nbut has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal \nchlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections).

However, in cases in which \nreinfection is unlikely and treatment failure is suspected, \nbefore retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be \nobtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) \nand antimicrobial susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is \nisolated. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing should \nbe performed by using Etest or agar dilution. All isolates \nof suspected treatment failures should be sent to CDC for \nantimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution; local \nlaboratories should store isolates for possible further testing if \nneeded. T esting or storage of specimens or isolates should be \nfacilitated by the state or local health department according to \nlocal public health protocol. Instructions for shipping isolates \nto CDC are available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/\narg/specimen_shipping_instructions1-29-08.pdf.\nFor persons with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, \nthe treating clinician should consult an infectious disease \nspecialist, the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention \nT raining Center clinical consultation line (https://www.stdccn.\norg/render/Public), the local or state health department STI \nprogram, or CDC (telephone: 800-232-4636) for advice about \nobtaining cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and \ntreatment. Suspected treatment failure should be reported to \nCDC through the local or state health department <24 hours \nafter diagnosis.\nPatients with suspected treatment failures should first be \nretreated routinely with the initial regimen used (ceftriaxone \n500 mg IM), with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia \ninfection exists, because reinfections are more likely than \nactual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher \nlikelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant \nclinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably \nwith simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility \ntesting before retreatment. Dual treatment with single doses \nof IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be \nconsidered, particularly when isolates are identified as having \nelevated cephalosporin MICs ( 885,886,895). Persons with \nsuspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative \nregimen (cefixime or gentamicin) should be treated with \nceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose or as a single dose with \nor without an antichlamydial agent on the basis of chlamydia \ninfection status. A test of cure at relevant clinical sites should \nbe obtained 7–14 days after retreatment; culture is the \nrecommended test, preferably with simultaneous NAAT , and \nantimicrobial susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae if isolated. \nClinicians should ensure that the patients’ sex partners from \nthe preceding 60 days are evaluated promptly with culture \nand presumptively treated by using the same regimen used \nfor the patients.\nSpecial Considerations\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is highest with \nfirst-generation cephalosporins but is rare (<1%) with \nthird-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and \ncefixime) (631,680,896).

Prevalence of infection among neonates depends on the \nprevalence of infection among pregnant women and whether \npregnant women are screened and treated for gonorrhea during\nRecommendations and Reports\n78 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4\nUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\npregnancy. The most severe manifestations of N. gonorrhoeae \ninfection among neonates are ophthalmia neonatorum and \nsepsis, which can include arthritis and meningitis. Less severe \nmanifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, and scalp \ninfection at sites of previous fetal monitoring.\nPreventing Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by \nN. gonorrhoeae\nOcular prophylaxis and preventive gonorrhea screening \nand treatment of infected pregnant women are especially \nimportant because ophthalmia neonatorum can result in \nperforation of the globe of the eye and blindness ( 903). \nOcular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum \nhas a long history of preventing sight-threatening gonococcal \nocular infections. Cases in the United States are uncommon, \nwhich is likely attributable to gonorrhea screening programs \nfor women, including pregnant women, that have contributed \nsubstantially to reduction in ophthalmia neonatorum ( 904). \nNeonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent \navailable in the United States, is required by law in most states \nand is recommended because of safety, low cost, and ease of \nadministration. It can contribute to preventing gonococcal \nblindness because not all pregnant women are screened for \ngonorrhea. The USPSTF recommends ocular prophylaxis \nwith erythromycin ointment for all newborns <24 hours \nafter birth ( 903). In addition to continuing routine ocular \nprophylaxis, prevention should focus on prenatal screening \nfor N. gonorrhoeae, including\n• screening pregnant women at risk (e.g., women aged \n<25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex \npartner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) for \nN. gonorrhoeae infection at the first prenatal visit;\n• treating all pregnant women with N. gonorrhoeae infection \nduring pregnancy and retesting in 3 months, in the third \ntrimester or at time of delivery (sex partners should be \ntested and treated);\n• retesting pregnant women in the third trimester who \ninitially tested negative but remained at increased risk for \nacquiring infection (e.g., women aged <25 years and those \naged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one \nsex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex \npartner who has an STI, or live in a community with high \nrates of gonorrhea); and\n• screening for gonorrhea at delivery for women not tested \nduring pregnancy and at risk for infection (e.g., women \naged <25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new \nsex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) or received \nno prenatal care; providers caring for the mother and the \nnewborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the \nresults of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if \npositive, prompt appropriate treatment of the newborn \nand mother.\nErythromycin is the only ophthalmic ointment recommended \nfor use among neonates. Silver nitrate and tetracycline \nophthalmic ointments are no longer manufactured in the \nUnited States, bacitracin is ineffective, and povidone iodine \nhas not been studied adequately ( 905,906).

For preadolescent girls, vaginitis is the most \ncommon manifestation of this infection; gonococcal-associated \nPID after vaginal infection can be less common among \npreadolescents than adults. Among sexually abused children, \nanorectal and pharyngeal infections with N. gonorrhoeae are \nfrequently asymptomatic.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nCulture can be used to test urogenital and extragenital sites for \ngirls and boys. NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae from \nvaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine for boys (see \nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Although data regarding \nNAAT from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among \nchildren are more limited, and performance is test dependent, \nno evidence supports that performance of NAAT for detection \nof N. gonorrhoeae among children differs from that among adults \n(553). Because of the implications of a N. gonorrhoeae diagnosis \nin a child, only validated FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be \nused with extragenital specimens. Consultation with an expert \nis necessary before using NAAT to minimize the possibility of \ncross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other \ncommensals (e.g., N. meningitidis , Neisseria sicca , Neisseria \nlactamica, Neisseria cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure \ncorrect interpretation of results.\nGram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children \nfor gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude \ngonorrhea. If evidence of DGI exists, gonorrhea culture and \nantimicrobial susceptibility testing should be obtained from \nrelevant clinical sites (see Disseminated Gonococcal Infection).\nRecommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal \nVulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis \nAmong Infants and Children Weighing ≤45 kg\nCeftriaxone 25–50 mg/kg body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to \nexceed 250 mg IM\nRecommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal \nVulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis \nAmong Children Weighing >45 kg\nTreat with the regimen recommended for adults \n(see Gonococcal Infections)\nRecommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among \nChildren Weighing ≤45 kg \nCeftriaxone 50 mg/kg body weight (maximum dose: 2 g) IM or IV in a \nsingle dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days\nRecommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among \nChildren Weighing >45 kg \nCeftriaxone 1 g IM or IV in a single dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days\nOther Management Considerations\nFollow-up cultures are unnecessary.

Prevalence of M. genitalium among women with \nPID ranges from 4% to 22% ( 925,926) and was reported \nas 60% in one study of women with postabortal PID ( 918). \nThe association with PID is supported by early studies among \nnonhuman primates that determined that endosalpingitis \ndevelops after inoculation with M. genitalium (927). Recent \nstudies evaluating the lower and upper genital tract using \nhighly sensitive M. genitalium NAAT assays or the role of \nM. genitalium in histologically defined endometritis have \nreported significantly elevated risk for PID (928). However, \nmost studies of M. genitalium and PID, even those that \ncontrolled extensively for other infections and behavioral and \nbiologic risk, are cross-sectional. The few prospective studies \nthat have evaluated the role of M. genitalium in establishing \nsubsequent PID demonstrated increased PID risk; however, \nthese were not statistically significant associations, often \nbecause of a lack of statistical power. No clinical trial data are \navailable that demonstrate that treating M. genitalium cervical \ninfection prevents development of PID or endometritis. \nAlthough data regarding the benefits of testing women with \nPID for M. genitalium and the importance of directing \ntreatment against this organism are limited, the associations of \nM. genitalium with cervicitis and PID in cross-sectional studies \nusing NAAT testing are consistent (928).\nData from case-control serologic studies ( 929 –931 ) \nand a meta-analysis of clinical studies ( 766) indicate a \npotential role in causing infertility. However, seroassays are \nsuboptimal and inconclusive. Similarly, evidence for a role for \nM. genitalium infection during pregnancy as a cause of perinatal \ncomplications, including preterm delivery, spontaneous \nabortion, or low birthweight, are conflicting because evidence is \ninsufficient to attribute cause (766,932–934). Data are limited \nregarding ectopic pregnancy and neonatal M. genitalium \ninfection (935,936).\nRectal infection with M. genitalium has been reported among \n1%–26% of MSM ( 937–940) and among 3% of women \n(941). Rectal infections often are asymptomatic, although \nhigher prevalence of M. genitalium has been reported among \nmen with rectal symptoms. Similarly, although asymptomatic \nM. genitalium has been detected in the pharynx, no evidence \nexists of it causing oropharyngeal symptoms or systemic disease.\nUrogenital M. genitalium infection is associated with HIV \namong both men and women ( 942–944); however, the data \nare from case-control and cross-sectional studies. Risk for HIV \ninfection is increased among women with M. genitalium, and \nevidence indicates that HIV shedding occurs more often among \npersons with M. genitalium and HIV infection who are not taking \nART than among persons without M. genitalium (942,944).\nAntimicrobial Resistance\nResistance to azithromycin has been rapidly increasing \nand has been confirmed in multiple studies.

Because \nof the high rates of macrolide resistance with treatment failures \n(707) and efficient selection of additional resistance, a 1-g dose \nof azithromycin should not be used.\nT wo-stage therapy approaches, ideally using resistance-\nguided therapy, are recommended for treatment. Resistance-\nguided therapy has demonstrated cure rates of >90% and \nshould be used whenever possible ( 759,963); however, it \nrequires access to macrolide-resistance testing. As part of this \napproach, doxycycline is provided as initial empiric therapy, \nwhich reduces the organism load and facilitates organism \nclearance, followed by macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium \ninfections treated with high-dose azithromycin; macrolide-\nresistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin (964,965).\nRecommended Regimens if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is \nAvailable\nIf macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for \n7 days, followed by azithromycin 1 g orally initial dose, followed by \n500 mg orally once daily for 3 additional days (2.5 g total)\nIf macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days \nfollowed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days\nRecommended Regimen if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is \nNot Available\nIf M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline \n100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg \norally once daily for 7 days\nAlthough the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive \nto moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse \nside effects and cost should be considered with this regimen. \nIn settings without access to resistance testing and when \nmoxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be \nconsidered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally \n2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin (1 g orally \non day 1 followed by 500 mg once daily for 3 days) and a test \nof cure 21 days after completion of therapy (963). Because of \nthe high prevalence of macrolide resistance and high likelihood \nof treatment failure, this regimen should be used only when \na test of cure is possible, and no other alternatives exist. If \nsymptomatic treatment failure or a positive test of cure occurs \nafter this regimen, expert consultation is recommended. \nData are limited regarding use of minocycline in instances of \ntreatment failure (966).\nRecommended PID treatment regimens are not effective \nagainst M. genitalium. Initial empiric therapy for PID, which \nincludes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, \nshould be provided at the time of presentation for care. If \nM. genitalium is detected, a regimen of moxifloxacin 400 mg \norally once daily for 14 days has been effective in eradicating the \norganism. Nevertheless, no data have been published that assess \nthe benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium, and \nthe importance of directing treatment against this organism \nis unknown.\nFollow-Up\nT est of cure is not recommended for asymptomatic persons \nwho received treatment with a recommended regimen.

The \ninfections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms \nare BV (i.e., replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth \nof anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, \nA. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious \nor uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal \nvaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually \ntransmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently \ndiagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are \nbeing evaluated for an STI.\nMultiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the \netiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can \nidentify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is \ndiscussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to \neach condition. In the clinician’s office, the cause of vaginal \nsymptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium \nhydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet \nmount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the \nvaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated \npH (i.e., >4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although \ntrichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). \nBecause pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge \nshould be further examined microscopically by first diluting \none sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on \none slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples \nthat emit an amine odor immediately upon application of \nKOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then \nplaced on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope \nat low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might \ndisplay motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e., epithelial cells \nwith borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which \nare characteristic of BV . The KOH specimen typically is used \nto identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. \nHowever, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements \nin KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the \nsensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with \nNAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast) (670). Presence of \nWBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also \nindicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).\nIn settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy \nare unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, \ndescribed in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be \nused. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation \nin the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing \nindicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or \nother noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. \nFor women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, \nreferral to a specialist should be considered.\nBacterial Vaginosis\nBV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal \nhydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus \nspecies in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic \nbacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus \nspecies, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable \nfeature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal \nepithelial cells ( 970). Certain women experience transient \nvaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for \nlonger intervals (971).

Vaginal \nGram stain, considered the reference standard laboratory \nmethod for diagnosing BV , is used to determine the relative \nconcentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long gram-positive rods), \nsmall gram-negative and gram-variable rods (i.e., G. vaginalis or \nBacteroides), and curved gram-negative rods (i.e., Mobiluncus) \ncharacteristic of BV . A Nugent score of 0–3 is consistent with \na Lactobacillus -predominant vaginal microbiota, 4–6 with \nintermediate microbiota (emergence of G. vaginalis), and 7–10 \nwith BV . Clinical diagnosis of BV by Amsel criteria requires at \nleast three of the following four symptoms or signs:\n• Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that \nsmoothly coats the vaginal walls\n• Clue cells (e.g., vaginal epithelial cells studded with \nadherent bacteria) on microscopic examination\n• pH of vaginal fluid >4.5\n• A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition \nof 10% KOH (i.e., the whiff test)\nDetection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated \nwith results by Gram stain (1001). The sensitivity and \nspecificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, \nrespectively, compared with the Nugent score (1002).\nIn addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are \navailable for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui \nDiagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity ( 1003,1004). \nThe Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide \nprobe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis \nnucleic acids (>5 x 10\n5 CFU of G. vaginalis/mL of vaginal \nfluid) for diagnosing BV , Candida species, and T . vaginalis. \nThis test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic \nwomen in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and \npresence of amine odor (sensitivity of 97%); specificity is \n81% compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam T est \nCard (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of \ntrimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis ), \nand proline aminopeptidase (1005). Sensitivity is 91% and \nspecificity is 61%, compared with Nugent. This test has \nprimarily been studied in resource-poor settings ( 1005), and \nalthough it has been reported to be beneficial compared with \nsyndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method \nfor BV diagnosis.\nMultiple BV NAATs are available for BV diagnosis among \nsymptomatic women (1002). These tests are based on detection \nof specific bacterial nucleic acids and have high sensitivity \nand specificity for BV (i.e., G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, BVAB2, \nor Megasphaera type 1) ( 1006) and certain lactobacilli (i.e., \nLactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus \ngasseri). They can be performed on either clinician- or self-\ncollected vaginal specimens with results available in <24 hours, \ndepending on the availability of the molecular diagnostic \nplatform (1002). Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are \navailable: Max Vaginal Panel (Becton Dickinson) ( 1007), \nAptima BV (Hologic), NuSwab VG (LabCorp) ( 1008), \nOneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR \n(Medical Diagnostic Laboratories) (1009), and SureSwab BV \n(Quest Diagnostics).

The previous warning \nagainst simultaneous use of alcohol and metronidazole was \nbased on laboratory experiments and individual case histories \nin which the reported reactions were equally likely to have been \ncaused by alcohol alone or by adverse effects of metronidazole.\nMetronidazole does not inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, \nas occurs with disulfiram. Ethanol alone or ethanol-\nindependent side effects of metronidazole might explain the \nsuspicion of disulfiram-like effects. Thus, refraining from \nalcohol use while taking metronidazole (or tinidazole) is \nunnecessary. Clindamycin cream is oil based and might weaken \nlatex condoms and diaphragms for 5 days after use (refer to \nclindamycin product labeling for additional information).\nWomen should be advised to refrain from sexual activity \nor to use condoms consistently and correctly during the BV \ntreatment regimen.

High-dose Vitamin D supplementation has not been \ndetermined to decrease BV recurrence in randomized controlled \ntrials (1033) and is not recommended.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nData from earlier clinical trials indicate that a woman’s \nresponse to therapy and the likelihood of relapse or recurrence \nare not affected by treatment of her sex partner (998). Therefore, \nroutine treatment of sex partners is not recommended. \nHowever, a pilot study reported that male partner treatment \n(i.e., metronidazole 400 mg orally 2 times/day in conjunction \nwith 2% clindamycin cream applied topically to the penile \nskin 2 times/day for 7 days) of women with recurrent BV \nhad an immediate and sustained effect on the composition of \nthe vaginal microbiota, with an overall decrease in bacterial \ndiversity at day 28 (1034). Male partner treatment also had an \nimmediate effect on the composition of the penile microbiota; \nhowever, this was not as pronounced at day 28, compared \nwith that among women. A phase 3 multicenter randomized \ndouble-blinded trial evaluating the efficacy of a 7-day oral \nmetronidazole regimen versus placebo for treatment of male \nsex partners of women with recurrent BV did not find that \nmale partner treatment reduced BV recurrence in female \npartners, although women whose male partners adhered \nto multidose metronidazole were less likely to experience \ntreatment failure (1035).\nSpecial Considerations\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions\nIntravaginal clindamycin cream is preferred in case of allergy \nor intolerance to metronidazole or tinidazole.

Seven \ntrials have evaluated treatment of pregnant women with \nasymptomatic BV at high risk for preterm delivery: one revealed \nharm (1045), two reported no benefit (1046,1047), and four \ndemonstrated benefit (1037,1038,1048,1049).\nT reatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women \nat low risk for preterm delivery has not been reported to \nreduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy in a large multicenter \nrandomized controlled trial ( 1050 ). Therefore, routine \nscreening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at \nhigh or low risk for preterm delivery for preventing preterm \nbirth is not recommended.\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal \noral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses \nthat are less than those used to treat infections among infants, \nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but \nremain less than maternal plasma levels ( https://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic ). Although \nmultiple reported case series identified no evidence of \nmetronidazole-associated adverse effects for breastfed infants, \ncertain clinicians recommend deferring breastfeeding for \n12–24 hours after maternal treatment with a single 2-g dose \nof metronidazole ( 1051). Lower doses produce a lower \nconcentration in breast milk and are considered compatible \nwith breastfeeding (1052,1053).\nHIV Infection\nBV appears to recur with higher frequency among women \nwho have HIV infection (1054). Women with HIV infection \nand BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those \nwho do not have HIV .\nTrichomoniasis\nT richomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral \nSTI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons \nin the United States ( 838,1055). Because trichomoniasis is \nnot a reportable disease (1056), and no recommendations are \navailable for general screening for T . vaginalis, the epidemiology \nof trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and \nclinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based \nT . vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among \nmales, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) \nand Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White \nwomen (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%) ( 1057,1058). \nUnlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T . vaginalis prevalence \nrates are as high among women aged >24 years as they are \nfor women aged <24 years (1057). Among persons attending \nnine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas \nprevalence was 14.6% among women (1059), and a study \nof STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified \na prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men \n(1060). Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of \ninfection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%) (1061). \nRates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at \n9%–32% of incarcerated women (386,387,391,392,1062) and \n3.2%–8% of incarcerated men (388). Women with a history of \nincarceration are two to five times more likely to have T . vaginalis \n(387,388,1063,1064). Other risk factors for T . vaginalis include \nhaving two or more sex partners during the previous year, having \nless than a high school education, and living below the national\n \npoverty level (1065). Women with BV are at higher risk for \nT . v\naginalis (1066).

A study of 500 men in San \nFrancisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T . vaginalis \n(1083); however, this might reflect deposition of T . vaginalis \nDNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of \nextragenital T . vaginalis among women have been published. \nThe efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital \nscreening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for \nextragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for \nT . vaginalis is not recommended.\nDiagnostic Considerations\nWet-mount microscopy traditionally has been used as \nthe preferred diagnostic test for T . vaginalis among women \nbecause it is inexpensive and can be performed at the POC; \nhowever, it has low sensitivity (44%–68%) compared with \nculture (1084–1086). T o improve detection, clinicians using \nwet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately \nafter specimen collection because sensitivity decreases quickly \nto 20% within 1 hour after collection ( 1087). More highly \nsensitive and specific molecular diagnostic options are available, \nwhich should be used in conjunction with a negative wet \nmount when possible.\nNAATs are highly sensitive, detecting more T . vaginalis \ninfections than wet-mount microscopy among women \n(1060). The Aptima T . vaginalis assay (Beckton Dickinson) is \nFDA cleared for detection of T . vaginalis from symptomatic \nor asymptomatic women. Reliable samples include \nclinician-collected endocervical swabs, clinician-collected \nvaginal swabs, female urine specimens, and liquid Pap \nsmear specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (Hologic) \n(698,1088 ). This assay detects RNA by transcription-\nmediated amplification with a sensitivity of 95.3%–100% \nand specificity of 95.2%–100%, compared with wet mount \nand culture (1088,1089). Among women, vaginal swabs and \nurine specimens have <100% concordance (1084). This assay \nhas not been FDA cleared for use among men and should be \ninternally validated in accordance with CLIA regulations before \nuse with urine or urethral swabs from men. The Probe T ec TV \nQ\nx Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson) is FDA cleared \nfor detection of T . vaginalis from vaginal (patient-collected \nor clinician-collected) swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine \nspecimens from women and has sensitivity of 98.3% and \nspecificity of 99.6%, compared with wet mount and culture \n(1090).

Culture has sensitivity of 44%–75% and \nspecificity of <100% (698,1086,1098). For women, vaginal \nsecretions are the preferred specimen type for culture because \nurine culture is less sensitive ( 698,1099,1100). For men, \nculture specimens require a urethral swab, urine sediment, \nor semen. T o improve diagnostic yield, multiple specimens \nfrom men can be used to inoculate a single culture. Cultures \nrequire an incubator and are necessary for T . vaginalis drug \nsusceptibility testing. The InPouch specimen should be \nexamined daily for 5 days over a 7-day period to reduce the \npossibility of false negatives (1101).\nAlthough T . vaginalis might be an incidental finding on a \nPap test, neither conventional nor liquid-based Pap smears \nare considered diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis; however, \nwomen with T . vaginalis identified on a Pap smear should be \nretested with sensitive diagnostic tests and treated if infection \nis confirmed (1102,1103).\nTreatment\nT reatment reduces symptoms and signs of T . vaginalis \ninfection and might reduce transmission. T reatment \nrecommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis \n(1104 ) and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly \nsymptomatic women without HIV infection ( 1105). The \nstudy demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg \norally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of \nwomen retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, \ncompared with women who received the 2-g single dose.

Retesting can be considered in \ncases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the \npreferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before \n3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection \nof residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant (1117).\nThe nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials \nknown to be effective against trichomonas infection. \nMetronidazole resistance occurs in 4%–10% of cases of \nvaginal trichomoniasis ( 1116,1118). Tinidazole resistance \nis less well studied but was present in 1% of infections in \none study ( 1116). Overall, more T . vaginalis isolates have \nreported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole (1119). \nMultidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose \ntreatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or \nhave a history of T . vaginalis (1120).\nNitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning \nbecause few alternatives to standard therapy exist. If treatment \nfailure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of \nmetronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has \nbeen reexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the \nsame regimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, \nshe should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g \nonce daily for 7 days. If a man has persistent T . vaginalis after \na single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed \nto an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single \n2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he \nshould be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg \n2 times/day for 7 days.\nFor persons who are experiencing persistent infection \nnot attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a \nkit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing ( https://\nwww.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.\nhtml?CDCT estCode=CDC-10239). CDC is experienced with \nsusceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T . vaginalis \nand can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of \ndrug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an \nalternative treatment regimen might be recommended. \nT reatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance \ncan include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. \nIf a patient has treatment failure after the 7-day regimen of \nhigh-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional \ntreatment options have been determined to have successful \nresults for women.

T reatment of T . vaginalis infection \ncan relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women \nand reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal \ntransmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment \nmight also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the \nnewborn (1136,1137). Clinicians should counsel symptomatic \npregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential \nrisks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of \npartner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual \ntransmission. The benefit of routine screening for T . vaginalis \nin asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral \ntherapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that \nare lower than those used to treat infections among infants, \nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but \nremain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/books/NBK501922). Although multiple reported case \nseries studies demonstrated no evidence of adverse effects among \ninfants exposed to metronidazole in breast milk, clinicians \nsometimes advise deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after \nmaternal treatment with metronidazole (1051). In one study, \nmaternal treatment with metronidazole (400 mg 3 times/day \nfor 7 days) produced a lower concentration in breast milk and \nwas considered compatible with breastfeeding over longer \nperiods (1052).\nData from studies involving human subjects are limited \nregarding tinidazole use during pregnancy; however, animal data \nindicate this drug poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should \nbe avoided for pregnant women, and breastfeeding should be \ndeferred for 72 hours after a single 2-g oral dose of tinidazole \n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922).\nHIV Infection\nUp to 53% of women with HIV have T . vaginalis infection \n(1115,1138). T . vaginalis infection among these women is \nsubstantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease \n(1082). Among women who are not virally suppressed, \ntreatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in \ngenital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding (1079,1139); \nhowever, no difference might occur among women who are \nvirally suppressed ( 1140). Because of the high prevalence \nof T . vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential \nfor adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and \npossibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and \nprompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV \ninfection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at \nleast annually thereafter.\nA randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV \nand T . vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose \nof metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg \n2 times/day for 7 days ( 1105). Factors that might interfere \nwith standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among \nwomen with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV \ninfection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired \nimmunity (1141).

Approximately 10%–20% of women \nwill have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and \ntherapeutic considerations.\nUncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\nDiagnostic Considerations\nA diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the \npresence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, \nand redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, \nand thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with \nuncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. \nThe diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and \nsymptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, \n10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding \nyeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test \nyields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is \nassociated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5). Use of 10% KOH \nin wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and \nmycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure \nthe yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with \nKOH preparation should be performed for all women with \nBOX 4.

For those with negative wet mounts but \nexisting signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should \nbe considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for \nthese women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying \nCandida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not \nan indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% \nof women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the \nvagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA \ncleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar \nwith the performance characteristics of the specific test used. \nYeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic \nyeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.\nTreatment\nShort-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and \nregimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. \nT reatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative \ncultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.\nRecommended Regimens for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\nOver-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents\nClotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days\nor\nClotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days\nor\nMiconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days\nor\nMiconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days\nor\nMiconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days\nor\nMiconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days\nor\nMiconazole 1,200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 1 day\nor\nTioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single application\nPrescription Intravaginal Agents\nButoconazole 2% cream (single-dose bioadhesive product) 5 g \nintravaginally in a single application\nor\nTerconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days\nor\nTerconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days", "n_chars": 4602, "n_tokens_est": 1150, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.778908Z"}

Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter \npreparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment \nof other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse \noutcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using \nprobiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.\nFollow-Up\nFollow-up typically is not required. However, women with \npersistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be \ninstructed to return for follow-up visits.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nUncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual \nintercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. \nA minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized \nby erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction \nwith pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment \nwith topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.\nSpecial Considerations\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\nT opical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although \nlocal burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally \ncause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the \noral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations \nof liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur \nwhen oral azoles are administered with other drugs (1141).\nComplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\nDiagnostic Considerations\nVaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women \nwith complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and \nidentify non– albicans Candida . Candida glabrata does not \nform pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized \non microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more \ncommon in vaginal isolates ( 1144,1145), and non– albicans \nCandida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture \nand susceptibility testing should be considered for patients \nwho remain symptomatic.\nRecurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\nRecurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes \nof symptomatic VVC in <1 year, affects <5% of women but \ncarries a substantial economic burden (1146). Recurrent VVC \ncan be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent \nantibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The \npathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the \nmajority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent \npredisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other \nnon–albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% \nof women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic \ntherapies are not as effective against these non–albicans yeasts \nas against C. albicans.\nTreatment\nMost episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans \nrespond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. \nHowever, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer \nduration of initial therapy (e.g., 7–14 days of topical therapy \nor a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole \nevery third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) \nis recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before \ninitiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.\nOral fluconazole (i.e., a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) \nweekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. \nIf this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used \nintermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance \ntherapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are \nrarely curative long-term (1147). Because C. albicans azole \nresistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if \navailable, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who \nremain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These \nwomen should be managed in consultation with a specialist.\nSevere Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\nSevere VVC (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema,", "n_chars": 4566, "n_tokens_est": 1141, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.779010Z"}

Therefore, no recommendation can be made.\nSpecial Considerations\nCompromised Host\nWomen with underlying immunodeficiency, those with \npoorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising \nconditions (e.g., HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression \ntherapy (e.g., corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as \nwell to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable \nconditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e., \n7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.\nPregnancy\nVVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical \nazole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use \namong pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a \nsingle 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with \nspontaneous abortion ( 1150) and congenital anomalies; \ntherefore, it should not be used (1151).\nHIV Infection\nVaginal Candida colonization rates among women with \nHIV infection are higher than among women without HIV \nwith similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, \nand the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of \nimmunosuppression (1152). Symptomatic VVC is also more \nfrequent among women with HIV infection and similarly \ncorrelates with severity of immunodeficiency ( 1153). In \naddition, among women with HIV , systemic azole exposure \nis associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species \nfrom the vagina.\nT reatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC \namong women with HIV infection should not differ from \nthat for women who do not have HIV . Although long-\nterm prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly \nhas been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and \nsymptomatic VVC (1154), this regimen is not recommended \nfor women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated \nVVC (98). Although VVC is associated with increased HIV \nseroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased \nHIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, \nthe effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and \ntransmission remains unknown.\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease\nPID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of \nthe upper female genital tract, including any combination \nof endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic \nperitonitis ( 1155–1157). Sexually transmitted organisms, \nespecially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis , often are \nimplicated. Recent studies report that the proportion of \nPID cases attributable to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is \ndecreasing; of women who received a diagnosis of acute PID, \napproximately 50% have a positive test for either of those \norganisms (1158–1160). Micro-organisms that comprise the \nvaginal flora, such as strict and facultative anaerobes ( 1160) \nand G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative rods, and \nStreptococcus agalactiae, have been associated with PID (1161). \nIn addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), T . vaginalis, M. hominis, \nand U. urealyticum might be associated with certain PID cases \n(1072). Data also indicate that M. genitalium might have a role \nin PID pathogenesis (765,928) and might be associated with \nmilder symptoms (919,923,928), although one study failed \nto demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of \nM. genitalium in the lower genital tract (925).\nScreening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia \nand gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID (1162,1163\n).

Regardless of positive predictive value, no single \nhistorical, physical, or laboratory finding is both sensitive \nand specific for the diagnosis of acute PID. Combinations of \ndiagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect \nmore women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more \nwomen who do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the \nother. For example, requiring two or more findings excludes \nmore women who do not have PID and reduces the number \nof women with PID who are identified.\nEpisodes of PID often go unrecognized.

The recommendations for \ndiagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to \nrecognize when PID should be suspected and when additional \ninformation should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. \nDiagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal \npain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, \novarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired \nby initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive \ntreatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active \nyoung women and other women at risk for STIs if they are \nexperiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for \nthe illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more \nof the following three minimum clinical criteria are present \non pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine \ntenderness, or adnexal tenderness.\nMore specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial \nbiopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; \ntransvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging \ntechniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or \nwithout free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler \nstudies indicating pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia); \nand laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic \nevaluation that includes some of these more extensive \nprocedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial \nbiopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who \ndo not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis \nis the only sign of PID for certain women.\nRequiring that all three minimum criteria be present \nbefore the initiation of empiric treatment can result in \ninsufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding \nwhether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also \nconsider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic \nevaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis \nand management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. \nFor example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract \ninflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal \nsecretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition \nto one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of \nthe diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria \ncan be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical \ncriteria and support a PID diagnosis:\n• Oral temperature >38.3°C (>101°F)\n• Abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical \nfriability\n• Presence of abundant numbers of WBCs on saline \nmicroscopy of vaginal fluid\n• Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n• Elevated C-reactive protein", "n_chars": 4594, "n_tokens_est": 1148, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.779281Z"}

Until treatment regimens that do not \ncover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent \nlong-term sequelae (e.g., infertility and ectopic pregnancy) \nas successfully as the regimens that are effective against these \nmicrobes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should \nbe considered. T reatment should be initiated as soon as the \npresumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of \nlong-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of \nrecommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or \nmoderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear \nto have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization \nis necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether \nthe woman meets any of the following criteria:\n• Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be \nexcluded\n• T ubo-ovarian abscess\n• Pregnancy\n• Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature \n>38.5°C (101°F)\n• Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen\n• No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy\nNo evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have \nimproved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, \nand the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar \namong younger and older women.

Clinical \nexperience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral \ntherapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of \nclinical improvement.

Oral and IV \nadministration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide \nsimilar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed \nand can be considered instead of IV for women without severe \nillness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible.

As a result of the emergence \nof quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, regimens that include \na quinolone agent are not recommended for PID treatment. \nHowever, if the patient has cephalosporin allergy, the \ncommunity prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea \nare low, and follow-up is likely, alternative therapy can be \nconsidered. Use of either levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily \nor moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole \n500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days ( 1179–1181) or \nazithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 1–2 doses, followed by \n250 mg orally daily in combination with metronidazole \n500 mg 2 times/day for 12–14 days (1178), can be considered. \nMoxifloxacin is the preferred quinolone antimicrobial for \nM. genitalium infections; however, the importance of providing \ncoverage for M. genitalium is unknown. Diagnostic tests for \ngonorrhea should be obtained before starting therapy, and \npersons should be managed as follows:\n• If a culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be \nbased on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n• If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant \nN. gonorrhoeae or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be \nassessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), consultation \nwith an infectious disease specialist is recommended.\nOther Management Considerations\nT o minimize disease transmission, women should be \ninstructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is \ncomplete, symptoms have resolved, and sex partners have been \ntreated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). \nAll women who receive a diagnosis of PID should be tested \nfor gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV , and syphilis.

These women \nshould be hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobials in \nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist.\nHIV Infection\nDifferences in PID clinical manifestations among women \nwith HIV infection and those without have not been well \ndelineated ( 1182). In early observational studies, women \nwith HIV infection and PID were more likely to require \nsurgical intervention. More comprehensive observational and \ncontrolled studies have demonstrated that women with HIV \ninfection and PID have similar symptoms, compared with \nwomen without HIV (1183–1185), except they are more likely \nto have a tubo-ovarian abscess. Women with HIV responded \nequally well to recommended parenteral and IM or oral \nantibiotic regimens as women without HIV . The microbiologic \nfindings for women with HIV and women without HIV \nwere similar, except women with HIV had higher rates of \nconcomitant M. hominis and streptococcal infections. These \ndata are insufficient for determining whether women with HIV \ninfection and PID require more aggressive management (e.g., \nhospitalization or IV antimicrobial regimens).\nIntrauterine Devices\nIUDs are one of the most effective contraceptive methods. \nCopper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are \navailable in the United States. The risk for PID associated with \nIUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion \n(1186–1188). If an IUD user receives a diagnosis of PID, \nthe IUD does not need to be removed ( 59,1189). However, \nthe woman should receive treatment according to these \nrecommendations and should have close clinical follow-up. \nIf no clinical improvement occurs within 48–72 hours of \ninitiating treatment, providers should consider removing \nthe IUD. A systematic review of evidence demonstrated that \ntreatment outcomes did not differ between women with PID \nwho retained the IUD and those who had the IUD removed \n(1190). These studies primarily included women using copper-\ncontaining or other nonhormonal IUDs. No studies are \navailable regarding treatment outcomes among women using \nlevonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.\nEpididymitis\nAcute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, \nswelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting \n<6 weeks ( 1191). Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a \ncondition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index \nof suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should \nbe maintained among men who have a sudden onset of \nsymptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition \nis a surgical emergency.\nAcute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g., C. trachomatis, \nN. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e., \nEscherichia coli ) (1192). Acute epididymitis caused by an \nSTI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently \nasymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually \ntransmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men \nwho are the insertive partner during anal sex.

Although inflammation and swelling \nusually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to \nthe rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord \nis usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) \ntorsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; \nhowever, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and \nmen without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men \nwith severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose \ntest results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary \ntract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is \nquestionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation \nfor testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might \nbe compromised.\nBilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes \nof testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the \nmost accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is \nnot routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily \nfor ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, \nunilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial \nspermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal \nultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion \nand epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound \nshould be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although \nultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and \nswelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal \ndiagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation \nconsistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does \nnot rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical \nmanagement. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion \nof the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain \nwho cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical \nexamination, and objective laboratory findings.\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated \nfor objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following \nPOC tests:\n• Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating \n≥2 WBCs per oil immersion field ( 737) (see Urethritis). \nThese stains are preferred POC diagnostic tests for \nevaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and \nspecific for documenting both urethral inflammation and \npresence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal \ninfection is established by documenting the presence of \nWBC-containing intracellular gram-negative or purple \ndiplococci on urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain, respectively.\n• Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.\n• Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-\nvoid urine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF .\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested \nfor C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT . Urine is \nthe preferred specimen for NAAT for men ( 553). Urine \ncultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are \ninsensitive and are not recommended.

Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur \nfor a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.\nOther Management Considerations\nMen who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to \nbe caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised \nto abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners \nhave been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with \nacute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.\nFollow-Up\nMen should be instructed to return to their health care \nproviders if their symptoms do not improve <72 hours after \ntreatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not \nsubside in <3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and \ntherapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that \npersist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be \nevaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, \ninfarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nMen who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis \nconfirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or \nC. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners \nduring the previous 60 days before symptom onset for \nevaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial \nInfections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse \nwas >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the \nmost recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. \nArrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT \nis an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who \nhave or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for \nwhom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed ( 125,126) \n(see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain \nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are \ntreated and symptoms have resolved.\nSpecial Considerations\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all \nthird-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) (658,681) \n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \nAllergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, \nclinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such \nregimens are required.\nHIV Infection\nMen with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute \nepididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as \nthose who do not have HIV . Other etiologic agents have \nbeen implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV , \nincluding CMV , salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, \nCorynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima \npolymorpha (1192).\nHuman Papillomavirus Infections\nApproximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at \nleast 40 of which infect the genital area (1194). The majority \nof HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or \nunrecognized. Sexually active persons are usually exposed to \nHPV during their lifetime ( 838,1195,1196). Oncogenic, \nhigh-risk HPV infection (e.g., HPV types 16 and 18) causes the \nmajority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal \ncancers and precancers (1197), whereas other HPV infection \n(e.g., HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent \nrespiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection \nis the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable \nprecancers and cancers.

HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of \nhistory of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or \nanogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine \nshould continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical \nCancer).

Impact-monitoring \nstudies in the United States have demonstrated reductions \nof genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within \nthe quadrivalent vaccine (1200–1203). Settings that provide \nSTI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible \nclients within the routine and catch-up age groups through \nage 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine \nseries, or link these persons to another facility equipped to \nprovide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, \nadolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about \nHPV and the vaccine ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/\nteens/for-hcp/hpv-resources.html). HPV vaccination has not \nbeen associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk \nbehaviors (1204,1205).\nAbstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method \nfor preventing genital HPV infection.

The majority of sexually active \npersons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, \nalthough most never know it.\n• Partners tend to share HPV , and it is not possible to \ndetermine which partner transmitted the original \ninfection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or \nhis or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.\n• Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection \nspontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable \nwith no associated health problems.\n• If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and \ncancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or \nneck might develop.\n• Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation \ncounseling, is important because of its contribution to the \nprogression of precancer and cancer.\n• The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different \nfrom the types that can cause cancer.", "n_chars": 1842, "n_tokens_est": 460, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.780089Z"}

In rare cases, a pregnant woman \ncan transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.\n• T reatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV \nbut not for the virus itself.\n• Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get \npregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain \nprecancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical \nprocedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman’s \nability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.\n• No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become \nundetectable and which will persist or progress to disease. \nHowever, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can determine \nwhether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer. These \ntests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are \nthey useful for women aged <25 years or men of any age.\nPrevention\n• Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers \ncaused by HPV . The 2vHPV , 4vHPV , and 9vHPV vaccines \nprotect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, \nalthough the 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also protect \nagainst the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine \nis available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe \nand effective and are recommended routinely for \nadolescents aged 11–12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also \nrecommended for older adolescents and young adults \nthrough age 26 years ( https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/\nindex.html ). Shared clinical decision-making is \nrecommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain \nadults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated \nper guidance ( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/\nwr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf).\n• Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the \nchances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing \nHPV-related diseases (e.g., genital warts or cervical cancer). \nHowever, because HPV can infect areas not covered by a \ncondom, condoms might not fully protect against HPV .\n• Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk \nfor HPV . However, even persons with only one lifetime \nsex partner can get HPV .\n• Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method \nfor preventing genital HPV infection.\nAnogenital Warts\nAnogenital warts are a common disease, and 90% are caused \nby nononcogenic HPV types 6 or 11. These types can be \ncommonly identified before or at the same time anogenital \nwarts are detected (1206). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 \nalso are occasionally identified in anogenital warts (usually \nas infections with HPV 6 or 11) and can be associated with \nfoci of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), \nparticularly among persons who have HIV infection. In \naddition to anogenital warts, HPV types 6 and 11 have been \nassociated with conjunctival, nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts.\nAnogenital warts are usually asymptomatic; however, \ndepending on the size and anatomic location, they can \nbe painful or pruritic.

For most patients, treatment results in \nresolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can \nresolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or \nnumber. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in <1 year, \nan acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment \nand wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for \nanogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, \nHPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting \nfrom treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.\nT reatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, \nnumber, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; \nconvenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No \ndefinitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment \nis superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all \npatients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between \na patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has \nbeen associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be \nencouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, \nclinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g., provider-\nadministered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy \nbetween visits to the provider). However, limited data exist \nregarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with \ncombination therapy. T reatment regimens are classified as either \npatient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-\napplied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they \ncan be administered in the privacy of their home. T o ensure \nthat patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should \nbe provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital \nwarts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. \nFollow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer \nany questions about use of the medication, address any side effects \nexperienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.\nRecommended Regimens for External Anogenital Warts (i.e., \nPenis, Groin, Scrotum, Vulva, Perineum, External Anus, or \nPerianus)*\nPatient-applied: Imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream†\nor\nPodofilox 0.5% solution or gel\nor\nSinecatechins 15% ointment†\nProvider-administered: Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe\nor\nSurgical removal by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave \nexcision, curettage, laser, or electrosurgery\nor\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) \n80%–90% solution\n* Persons with external anal or perianal warts might also have intra-anal \nwarts.

Local anesthesia (topical or injected) might facilitate \ntherapy if warts are present in many areas or if the area of warts \nis large. Surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating the \nmajority of warts at a single visit, although recurrence can \noccur. Surgical removal requires substantial clinical training, \nadditional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit. After \nlocal anesthesia is applied, anogenital warts can be physically \ndestroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional \nhemostasis is required. Care should be taken to control the \ndepth of electrocautery to prevent scarring. Alternatively, the \nwarts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of \nfine scissors or a scalpel, by CO\n2 laser, or by curettage. Because \nmost warts are exophytic, this procedure can be accomplished \nwith a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis. \nHemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in \ncases of minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum \nchloride solution). Suturing is neither required nor indicated \nin the majority of cases. For patients with large or extensive \nwarts, surgical therapy, including CO\n2 laser, might be most \nbeneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral \nwarts, particularly for those persons whose warts have not \nresponded to other treatments. T reatment of anogenital and \noral warts should be performed in a ventilated room by using \nstandard precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/\nguidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf#page) and \nlocal exhaust ventilation (e.g., a smoke evacuator) (1226).\nT richloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) \nare provider-administered caustic agents that destroy warts by \nchemical coagulation of proteins. Although these preparations \nare widely used, they have not been investigated thoroughly. \nTCA solution has a low viscosity, comparable with that of \nwater, and can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if \napplied excessively. A small amount should be applied only \nto the warts and allowed to dry (i.e., develop white frost on \ntissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense or an \nexcess amount of acid is applied, the area can be covered with \nsodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), washed with liquid \nsoap preparations, or be powdered with talc to neutralize the \nacid or remove unreacted acid. TCA or BCA treatment can be \nrepeated weekly if necessary.\nAlternative Regimens for External Genital Warts\nFewer data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative \nregimens for treating anogenital warts, which include \npodophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic \ntherapy, and topical cidofovir.

Factors that might affect response to therapy include \nimmunosuppression and treatment compliance. Warts \nlocated on moist surfaces or in intertriginous areas respond \nbest to topical treatment. A new treatment modality should \nbe selected when no substantial improvement is observed \nafter a complete course of treatment or in the event of severe \nside effects; treatment response and therapy-associated side \neffects should be evaluated throughout the therapy course. \nComplications occur rarely when treatment is administered \ncorrectly. Persistent hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation \ncan occur with ablative modalities (e.g., cryotherapy and \nelectrocautery) and have been described with immune \nmodulating therapies (e.g., imiquimod cream). Depressed or \nhypertrophic scars are uncommon but can occur, especially \nif patients have insufficient time to heal between treatments. \nRarely, treatment can result in chronic pain syndromes (e.g., \nvulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in the \ncase of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.\nCounseling\nWhen counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider \nshould discuss the following:\n• If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, \nor increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause \ngenital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.\n• Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more \noften than other women.\n• Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively \ndetermined. Genital warts can develop months or years \nafter acquiring HPV .\n• HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to \nanother person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex \npartners tend to share HPV , even though signs of HPV \n(e.g., warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.\n• Although genital warts are common and benign, certain \npersons might experience considerable psychosocial impact \nafter receiving this diagnosis.\n• Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does \nnot cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often \nrecur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.\n• Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons \nwith genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. \nHPV might remain present and can still be transmitted \nto partners even after the warts are gone.\n• Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital \nwarts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV \ncan infect areas that are not covered by a condom and \nmight not fully protect against HPV .\n• A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent \ngenital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV \nor genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of \ncases of genital warts among persons who have not yet \nbeen exposed to wart-causing types of HPV .\nManagement of Sex Partners\nPersons should inform current partners about having genital \nwarts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed \non to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might \nalready have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, \nHPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is \nnot recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical \nexamination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No \nrecommendations can be made regarding informing future sex \npartners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration \nof viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.\nSpecial Considerations", "n_chars": 4598, "n_tokens_est": 1149, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.780541Z"}

Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or \nresembling anogenital warts might occur more frequently \namong immunosuppressed persons, therefore requiring biopsy \nfor confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases (1235–1237).\nHigh-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions\nBiopsy of an atypical wart might reveal HSIL or cancer of \nthe anogenital tract.

However, cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated \ncancer for which routine screening is recommended.\nCervical Cancer\nScreening Recommendations\nRecommendations for cervical cancer screening in the \nUnited States are based on systematic evidence reviews \nby major medical and advocacy organizations, including \nUSPSTF (174), ACS (177), and ACOG ( 175). Over time, \ngeneral alignment across these organizations has emerged as \nto when to start and end cervical cancer screening as well as \nthe periodicity of screening. Although no single guideline \nuniversally guides screening practices in the United States, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act required Medicaid \nand new private health insurance plans to provide coverage for \npreventive services graded A or B by USPSTF , which includes \ncervical cancer screening. In addition, the National Center for \nQuality Assurance provides a set of measures (the Healthcare \nEffectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]) for up-to-\ndate cervical cancer screening that aligns with USPSTF \nrecommendations ( https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/\ncervical-cancer-screening ). The Center for Medicaid and \nMedicare Services uses the same measure as HEDIS to measure \ncervical cancer screening performance.\nUSPSTF screening recommendations apply to persons with \na cervix at average risk, defined as those with no previous \ncervical cancer or high-grade precancer, not currently \nunder close follow-up for a recent abnormal result, not \nimmunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV), and who \nhad no exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Among these \npersons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years \nand continue through age 65 years. T esting can be performed \nusing either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e., \nPap tests). For persons aged ≥30 years, screening can include \nFDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV . \nFor cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified \nlaboratories using acceptable terminology (Bethesda 2001 or \nLAST terminology) (1239).\nAnnual cervical cancer screening is not recommended for \npersons at average risk. Instead, cytology testing is recommended \nevery 3 years for persons aged 21–29 years. For persons aged \n30–65 years, a cytology test every 3 years, an HPV test alone \nevery 5 years, or a cytology test plus an HPV test (cotest) every \n5 years is recommended.

Patients with abnormal cervical cancer \nscreening test results should be counseled about those results \n(see Counseling Messages).\nThe following additional management considerations are \nassociated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:\n• Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be \nconsidered screening tests for STIs.\n• All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer \nscreening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity (i.e., those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, \nheterosexual, or transgender).\n• A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is \nsmeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for \n10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based \ncytology can be performed at any time during the \nmenstrual cycle.\n• If specific infections other than HPV (e.g., chlamydia or \ngonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test \nafter appropriate treatment for those infections might be \nindicated. However, in most instances (even in the \npresence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology \ntests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and \nreliable final reports can be produced without the need to \nrepeat the cytology test after treatment.\n• The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not \npostpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after \nremoval of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.\n• HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or \nby using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.\n• In the absence of other indications, the presence of external \ngenital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical \ncancer screening.\n• The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection \nof other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test \nresults or their interpretation ( 600). Typically, vaginal \nspecimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea \nscreening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical \nspecimens for STI testing can be collected first.\n• Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal \nof the cervix do not require screening unless cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma \nin situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years \n(175,1247). If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical \nhysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be \nperformed as indicated (1248–1250).\n• Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test \ncollection and use simple quality assurance measures are \nmore likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined \nby the laboratory).\n• The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical \ntransformation zone (e.g., cytobrushes) improves the \naccuracy of cytology tests (1251).\n• Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable \nbecause they have similar test-performance characteristics.\n• At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their \nrecent cytology test and HPV results and any history of \nevaluation and treatment (e.g., loop electrosurgical \nexcision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with \nmanagement; effort should be made to obtain copies of \nrecent results. The importance and frequency of screening \nshould be reinforced.\nCounseling\nPersons might believe the cytology (Pap test) or HPV test \nscreens for conditions other than cervical cancer, or they \nmight be confused by abnormal results (1252–1254).

A \npositive HPV test might elicit concerns about partners, worries \nabout disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization \n(1260). Providers should frame HPV positivity in a neutral, \nnonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common, \nasymptomatic, and transient nature. Providers also should \nemphasize that HPV infections often are shared between \npartners but it is often not possible to know the origin of an \nHPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years \nafter initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections \nin both male and female partners.

These interventions are more effective if they are \nimplemented with interventions to increase provider delivery \nof screening services (e.g., provider assessment and feedback, \nprovider incentives, and provider reminders). Print materials \nand online resources are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\ncancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm and https://www.\ncdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm. Patient navigators can \nbe effective in improving both screening and follow-up after \nabnormal results (1267).\nKey Messages About Cervical Cancer Screening\nWhen counseling persons about cervical cancer screening, \nthe provider should discuss the following:\n• Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests, \nlike the Pap test (cytology) and HPV tests. Those at average \nrisk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years.\n• The cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells, which \ncould lead to cervical cancer over time, and an HPV test \ndetects HPV infection of the cervix. The HPV test can be \nused alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time \nas the cytology test (known as cotesting) for those aged \n≥30 years to 65 years. The HPV test is also used after a \ncytology test result of atypical squamous cells of \nundetermined significance (ASC-US) among persons aged \n>25 years (known as reflex HPV testing).\n• Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical \nprecancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms \nuntil they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is \nessential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.\n• HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by \nthe body without any medical interventions. A positive \nHPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.\n• Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are \nshared between partners, and it is often not possible to know \nthe origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become \npositive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation \nof latent infections in both male and female partners.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nThe benefit of disclosing a positive HPV test to current \nand future sex partners is unclear. The following counseling \nmessages can be communicated to sex partners:\n• Sex partners do not need to be tested for HPV .\n• Sex partners tend to share HPV . Sex partners of persons \nwith HPV infection also are likely have an HPV infection.\n• Female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous \nfemale partner with HPV should be screened at the same \nintervals as women with average risk. No data are available \nto suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit.\n• When used correctly and consistently, condoms might \nlower the risk for HPV infection and might decrease the \ntime to clear in those with HPV infection. However, HPV \ncan infect areas not covered by the condom, and condoms \nmight not fully protect against HPV (24,25).\nAdditional messages for partners include the messages for persons \nwith HPV (see Cervical Cancer Screening; Counseling Messages).\nScreening Recommendations in Special \nPopulations\nPregnancy\nPersons who are pregnant should be screened at the same", "n_chars": 4598, "n_tokens_est": 1149, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.781107Z"}

Adolescents with HIV should be screened 1 year \nafter onset of sexual activity but no later than age 21 years. \nSexually active persons should be screened at the time of the \ninitial HIV diagnosis. Conventional or liquid-based cytology \n(Pap test) should be used as primary HPV testing and is not \nrecommended in individuals with HIV .

For these reasons, \ncervical cancer screening and HPV testing are not recommended \nin immunocompetent adolescents. However, for adolescents \nwith HIV infection, providers should screen 1 year after onset of \nsexual activity, regardless of age or mode of HIV acquisition (e.g., \nperinatally acquired or sexually acquired) (98); such screening \nis warranted because of the reported high rate of progression of \nabnormal cytology in adolescents with HIV .\nHuman Papillomavirus Tests for Cervical \nCancer Screening\nClinical tests for HPV are used for the following: cervical \ncancer screening as a primary test, cervical cancer screening \nwith a cytology test, triage of some abnormal cervical \ncytology results, follow-up after abnormal screening test \nresults, follow-up after a colposcopy in which no CIN 2 or \nCIN 3 is found, and follow-up after treatment of cervical \nprecancers. These tests are only FDA cleared for use with \ncervical specimens, not oral or anal specimens. T esting \nfor nononcogenic HPV types (e.g., types 6 and 11) is not \nrecommended (https://www.asccp.org/guidelines).\nFDA-cleared HPV tests detect viral DNA or messenger \nRNA. Several FDA-cleared tests for HPV are available for \nuse in the United States. The Cobas 4800 HPV test (Roche \nMolecular Diagnostics) and the Onclarity HPV test (Becton \nDickinson) can detect the presence of 14 oncogenic HPV types \n(types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and \n68), as well as individual types 16 and 18, and are cleared for \nprimary cervical cancer screening.\nOther HPV tests are cleared for use in conjunction with \na cytology test or to triage some abnormal cervical cytology \nresults; they should not be used for primary HPV testing \nbecause they are not cleared for this purpose. These tests \ninclude the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test \n(Qiagen), the Cervista HPV High-Risk DNA and HPV 16/18 \nDNA tests (Hologics), and the APTIMA HR HPV (Gen \nProbe) test. All HPV assays should be FDA cleared and used \nonly for the appropriate indications ( https://www.fda.gov/\nmedia/122799/download) (158).\nHPV testing should not be performed in the following situations:\n• Deciding whether to vaccinate against HPV\n• Conducting HPV tests for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV \ntypes (e.g., types 6 and 11)\n• Providing care to persons with genital warts or their partners\n• T esting persons aged <25 years as part of routine cervical \ncancer screening\n• T esting oral or anal specimens\nUnlike cytology, samples for HPV testing have the potential \nto be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs \nfor analysis, thus self-collection might be one strategy for \nincreasing screening rates among populations where screening \nrates are low.

Incidence is variable among \nwomen with previous HPV-related gynecologic dysplasia and \ncancer (6–63 cases per 100,000 person-years) ( 1280,1281). \nPersistent HPV infection might be a risk factor for preventable \nHPV-associated second primary cancers among survivors of \nHPV-associated cancers (1282).\nData are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer \nscreening with anal cytology in persons with HIV infection, \nMSM without HIV infection, and the general population. An \nannual digital anorectal examination (DARE) might be useful \nto detect masses on palpation in persons with HIV infection \nand possibly in MSM without HIV with a history of receptive \nanal intercourse ( 98).

Recurrence rates with both provider-\napplied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging \nfrom approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years \n(1289,1292,1293). In addition, evidence exists that HSIL \nmight spontaneously regress without treatment (1294,1295). \nShared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is \nrecommended because of limited data on the natural history \nof anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or \nregression of lesions.\nViral Hepatitis\nHepatitis A Virus Infection\nHAV infection has an incubation period of approximately \n28 days (range: 15–50 days) (1296). HAV replicates in the liver \nand is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2–3 weeks \nbefore to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. HAV infection \nproduces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic \ninfection or chronic liver disease. However, approximately \n10% of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during \nthe 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from \nhepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk \nfor symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with \napproximately 70% of adults having symptoms compatible \nwith acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having \neither asymptomatic or unrecognized infection. Antibody \nproduced in response to HAV infection persists for life and \nconfers protection against reinfection (1297).\nHAV infection is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, \nby either person-to-person contact or through consumption \nof contaminated food or water (1298). T ransmission of HAV \nduring sexual activity probably results from fecal-oral contact. \nAlthough viremia occurs early during infection and can persist \nfor weeks after symptom onset, bloodborne transmission of \nHAV is uncommon (1299). T ransmission by saliva has not \nbeen demonstrated.\nIn the United States, of the hepatitis A cases accompanied by \nrisk information, a particular risk was identified among only \n23.8% (13,372). Among cases with a risk factor identified, a \nrecognized foodborne or waterborne outbreak was the most \ncommonly identified risk (49.6%). Other infection sources \nidentified in the United States include MSM; persons who \nuse injecting drugs; sexual and household contacts; those \nexperiencing homelessness; international travelers; those with \nchildren attending a nursery, childcare, or preschool; and \npersons working in such settings (13,372).\nDiagnostic Considerations\nDiagnosis of HAV infection cannot be made on a clinical \nbasis alone but requires serologic testing. Presence of IgM \nantibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A \npositive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV \ninfection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV \ninfection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the \nlow level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV \ntests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.\nTreatment\nPatients with acute HAV infection usually require only \nsupportive care, with no restrictions in diet or activity. \nHospitalization might be necessary for patients who become \ndehydrated because of nausea and vomiting and is crucial \nfor patients with signs or symptoms of acute liver failure. \nMedications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized \nby the liver should be used with caution among persons with \nHAV infection.\nPrevention", "n_chars": 4552, "n_tokens_est": 1138, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.781668Z"}

Prevaccination serologic testing \nof children is not indicated because of the low prevalence of \ninfection among that age group.\nFor populations who are expected to have high rates of previous \nHAV infection, vaccination history should be obtained when \nfeasible before testing or vaccination. Vaccination should not be \npostponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained, records are \nunavailable, or prevaccination testing is infeasible. Vaccinating \npersons immune from natural infection carries no known risk, nor \ndoes giving extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine (1307). Vaccination \nof a person who is already immune is not harmful. Persons who \nhave a documented history of ≥2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine do \nnot need further vaccination or serologic testing.\nPostvaccination Serologic Testing\nSerologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine \nvaccination of infants, children, or adults ( 1297). T esting \nfor anti-HAV antibody after vaccination is recommended \nfor persons whose subsequent clinical management depends \non knowledge of their immune status and persons for whom \nrevaccination might be indicated (e.g., persons with HIV \ninfection and other immunocompromising conditions).\nPostexposure Prophylaxis\nPersons who recently have been exposed to HAV and who \npreviously have not received hepatitis A vaccine should be \nadministered a single dose of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine \nor immunoglobulin (IG) (0.1 mL/kg body weight) as soon as \npossible, ideally <2 weeks after exposure because the efficacy \nof vaccine or IG when administered >2 weeks after exposure \nhas not been established ( 1297). In most cases, monovalent \nhepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred \nover IG for PEP . Advantages of hepatitis A vaccine for PEP \ninclude induction of active immunity, longer-term protection, \nease of administration, and better acceptability and availability. \nDecisions to use vaccine versus IG should be guided by patient \ncharacteristics associated with more severe manifestations \nof HAV infection (e.g., older age, immunocompromising \nconditions, and chronic liver disease) and the magnitude of the \nrisk for HAV transmission resulting from the exposure (1297).\nIG should be used for children aged <6 months, \nimmunocompromised persons, persons with chronic liver \ndisease, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated. IG \ncan be administered to persons aged >40 years, in addition to \nhepatitis A vaccine (1297).\nIG administered IM can provide PEP against HAV (T able 4). \nIG is a sterile solution of concentrated immunoglobulins prepared \nTABLE 4.

In the United States, IG is produced only from \nplasma that has tested negative for HBsAg, antibodies to HIV \nand HCV , and HIV and HCV RNA. In addition, the process \nused to manufacture IG inactivates viruses (e.g., HBV , HCV , \nand HIV). When administered IM <2 weeks after exposure to \nHAV , IG is >85% effective in preventing HAV infection (1308).\nIf IG is administered to persons for whom hepatitis A vaccine \nalso is recommended, a dose of vaccine should be provided \nsimultaneously with IG in different anatomic sites (e.g., \ndifferent limbs) as soon as possible, and the second vaccine dose \nshould be administered according to the licensed schedule to \ncomplete the series. The combined vaccine can be considered \nfor persons among whom both hepatitis A and hepatitis B \nvaccine is recommended (13,1297,1302–1304).\nSpecial Considerations\nFor persons with HIV infection, antibody response can be \ndirectly related to CD4+ T-cell levels. Although persons with \nHIV who have lower CD4+ T-cell counts or percentages might \nhave a weaker response to the vaccine, vaccination should \nnot be delayed for the CD4\n+ T-cell count to exceed a certain \nthreshold because of the prolonged risk for HAV exposure \ncreated by missed opportunities to vaccinate.\nHepatitis B Virus Infection\nThe incubation period for HBV infection from time of \nexposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. \nThe highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with \nlower concentrations in other body fluids including wound \nexudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva ( 1309,1310). \nHBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment \nthan other bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HCV or HIV).\nHBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. \nAmong adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV \ninfections are symptomatic, and approximately 1% of reported \ncases result in acute liver failure and death ( 1311). Risk for \nchronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; \napproximately 90% of infected infants and 30% of infected \nchildren aged <5 years become chronically infected, compared \nwith 2%–6% of persons who become infected as adults (1312). \nAmong persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for \npremature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma \nis 15%–25% (1313).\nHBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous \nmembrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids \nthat contain HBV . The primary risk factors associated with \ninfection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex \nwith an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having \nsex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug \nuse (233). In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes \nof HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses \nin health care infection control procedures, as less common \nsources of transmission (1314–1317).\nCDC’s national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV \ninfection includes prevention of perinatal infection through \nroutine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and \nimmunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg \nor mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant \nvaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children \nand adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of \npreviously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection \n(12). High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent \ndecreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved \namong infants and adolescents ( 1318). The vaccination of \npersons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved \nvaccination coverage among adults aged <30 years (1319) and \ncorresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this", "n_chars": 4552, "n_tokens_est": 1138, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.782043Z"}

In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority \nof adult populations at high risk aged ≥30 years (e.g., persons \nwith multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) \nhas remained low (1320,1321); these groups account for the \nhighest rates of preventable acute infections (12,1319,1322). \nSTD clinics and other health care settings providing STI \nservices to adults at high risk for infection should administer \nhepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires \nserologic testing (Table 5).

HBIG provides temporary (i.e., 3–6 months) \nprotection from HBV infection and is typically used as \nPEP as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccination for previously \nunvaccinated persons or for persons who have not responded to \nvaccination. HBIG is prepared from plasma known to contain \nhigh concentrations of anti-HBs. The recommended dose of \nHBIG is 0.06 mL/kg body weight.\nHepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg produced in yeast by \nrecombinant DNA technology and provides protection from \nHBV infection when used for both pre-exposure vaccination \nand PEP . The three available monovalent hepatitis B vaccines \nfor use in the United States are Recombivax HB, Engerix-B, \nand Heplisav-B. A combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B \nvaccine for use among persons aged ≥18 years, T winrix, also \nis available.\nWhen selecting a hepatitis B vaccination schedule, health care \nproviders should consider the need to achieve completion of \nthe vaccine series. The recommended HBV dose and schedule \nvaries by product and age of recipient (Table 6). Three different \n3-dose schedules for adolescents and adults have been approved \nfor both monovalent hepatitis B vaccines (i.e., Engerix-B and \nRecombivax HB); these vaccines can be administered at 0, 1, \nand 6 months; 0, 1, and 4 months; or 0, 2, and 4 months. \nA 4-dose schedule of Engerix-B at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months is \nlicensed for all age groups. A 2-dose schedule of Recombivax \nHB adult formulation (10 µg) is licensed for adolescents \naged 11–15 years, with a 4-month minimal interval between \ndoses. When scheduled to receive the second dose, adolescents \naged 16–19 years should be switched to a 3-dose series, with \ndoses 2 and 3 consisting of the pediatric formulation (5 µg) \nadministered on a recommended schedule.

Serologic \ntesting should not be a barrier to vaccination. The first vaccine \ndose should be administered immediately after collection of the \nblood sample for serologic testing. Vaccination of persons who \nare immune to HBV infection because of current or previous \ninfection or vaccination is not harmful and does not increase \nthe risk for adverse events.\nPrevaccination testing should be performed with HBsAg, \nanti-HBs, and total anti-HBc to define patients’ HBV clinical \nstatus and deliver recommended care ( 1330). Persons who \ntest HBsAg positive should receive prevention counseling and \nevaluation for antiviral treatment (see Management of Persons \nWho Are HBsAg Positive). Persons who test total anti-HBc \npositive and anti-HBs positive should be counseled that they \nhave had previous HBV infection and are immune. Those \npersons with isolated anti-HBc (i.e., negative HBsAg and \nanti-HBs) need further assessment to rule out occult HBV \ninfection, and they are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed \nto immunosuppressants. Persons who test negative to all three \nHBV seromarkers should receive the complete vaccination \nseries, with the first vaccine dose administered immediately.\nPostvaccination Serologic Testing for Response\nPostvaccination serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary \nafter routine vaccination of adolescents or adults. However, \nsuch testing is recommended for persons whose subsequent \nclinical management depends on knowledge of their immune \nstatus. Persons recommended to receive postvaccination \nserologic testing include health care personnel and public safety \nworkers, persons with HIV infection, sex and needle-sharing \npartners of HBsAg-positive persons, hemodialysis patients \nand others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g., \npredialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home dialysis), and other \nimmunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stem-cell \ntransplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy) (1318).\nIf indicated, anti-HBs testing should be performed \n1–2 months after administration of the last dose of the \nvaccine series. Persons determined to have anti-HBs levels \nof <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be \nrevaccinated with a 3-dose series and tested again for anti-HBs \n1–2 months after the third dose. Persons who do not respond to \nrevaccination should be tested for HBsAg and HBc. If HBsAg \npositive, persons should receive recommended management \n(see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). If \nHBsAg negative, persons should be considered susceptible to \nHBV infection and counseled about precautions for preventing \nHBV infection and the need for HBIG PEP for any known \nexposure. If isolated anti-HBc positive (i.e., negative HBsAg \nand anti-HBs), persons will need further assessment to rule out \noccult HBV infection and are at higher risk for reactivation if \nexposed to immunosuppressants.\nPostexposure Prophylaxis\nBoth passive and active PEP (simultaneous administration of \nHBIG [i.e., 0.06 mL/kg body weight] and hepatitis B vaccine \nat separate anatomic sites) and active PEP (administration of \nhepatitis B vaccination alone) have been demonstrated to be \nhighly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to \nHBV (12).

Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs \n1–2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination \nSerologic T esting). Modified dosing regimens, including a \ndoubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of \nadditional doses, might increase the response rate and should be \nmanaged in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. \nAdditional recommendations for management of persons with \nHBsAg and HIV infection are available (98).\nHepatitis C Virus Infection\nHCV infection is the most common chronic bloodborne \ninfection in the United States, with an estimated 2.4 million \npersons living with chronic infection ( 1332). HCV is not \nefficiently transmitted through sex (1333–1335). Studies of \nHCV transmission between heterosexual couples and MSM \nhave yielded mixed results; however, studies have reported \neither no or minimally increased rates of HCV infection \namong partners of persons with HCV infection compared \nwith partners of those without HCV (1334, 1336–1338). \nHowever, data indicate that sexual transmission of HCV \ncan occur, especially among persons with HIV infection. \nIncreasing incidence of acute HCV infection among MSM \nwith HIV infection has been reported in multiple U.S. \n(96,236,239,1339) and European cities (237,1340–1342).

However, infected persons are a source of transmission to \nothers and are at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma \ndecades after infection.\nHCV is primarily transmitted parenterally, usually through \nshared drug-injecting needles and paraphernalia. HCV also \ncan be transmitted through exposures in health care settings \nas a consequence of inadequate infection control practices \n(1314). T ransmission after receipt of blood from donors and \nfrom transplantation of tissues and organs with HCV infection \nhas occurred only rarely since 1992, when routine screening \nof these donated products was mandated in the United \nStates ( 1367,1369). Tattoos applied in regulated settings \nhave not been associated with HCV transmission, although \nthose obtained in certain settings have been linked to such \ntransmission (1336). Occupational and perinatal exposures also \ncan result in transmission of HCV; however, such transmission \nis uncommon.\nAcute HCV infection is a reportable condition in 49 states. \nMatching viral hepatitis and HIV surveillance registries, and \nmolecular epidemiologic assessments, can facilitate early \ndetection of social networks of HCV transmission among \nMSM with HIV infection.\nCDC recommends hepatitis C screening at least once in a \nlifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years and for all women during \neach pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of \nHCV infection is <0.1% (156). One-time hepatitis C testing \nis also recommended regardless of age, setting, or recognized \nconditions or exposures (e.g., HIV infection, history of \ninjecting drug use, or children born to women with HCV \ninfection). Routine periodic HCV testing is recommended \nfor persons with ongoing risk factors (e.g., injecting drug use \nor hemodialysis).\nDiagnosis\nT esting for HCV infection should include use of an FDA-\ncleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or \nenhanced CIA and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody \ntest) followed by NAAT to detect HCV RNA for those with a \npositive antibody result (1370). Persons with HIV infection with \nlow CD4\n+ T-cell count might require further testing by NAAT \nbecause of the potential for a false-negative antibody assay.\nPersons determined to have HCV infection (i.e., positive \nfor HCV RNA) should be evaluated for treatment. Antibody \nto HCV remains positive after spontaneously resolving or \nsuccessful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for HCV \nreinfection among persons with ongoing risk factors should \nbe limited to HCV RNA. Persons who have spontaneous \nresolution or who have undergone successful treatment are \nnot immune to reinfection.\nTreatment\nHCV infection is curable, and persons with diagnosed HCV \ninfection should be linked to care and treatment. Providers \nshould consult existing guidelines to learn about the latest \nadvances in treating HCV infection (https://www.hcvguidelines.\norg) and with hepatitis specialists, as needed. Persons at high \nrisk for transmitting HCV to others should be treated both for \nindividual benefit and to prevent HCV transmission.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nBecause incident HCV has not been demonstrated to \noccur among heterosexual couples followed over time \n(1334,1371–1373), condom use might not be necessary in \nsuch circumstances. Persons with HCV infection with one \nlong-term, steady sex partner do not need to change their \nsexual practices. However, they should discuss the risk for \ntransmission with their partner and discuss the need for \ntesting (234) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm). \nHeterosexual persons and MSM with HCV infection and \nmore than one partner, especially those with concurrent HIV \ninfection, should protect their partners against HCV and HIV \nacquisition by using external latex condoms (237,1358,1374)", "n_chars": 4561, "n_tokens_est": 1140, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.782815Z"}

Women with HCV infection do not need \nto avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding, although children born to \nwomen with HCV also should be tested for HCV .\nPersons who use or inject drugs should be counseled about \nthe importance of prevention and provided access to substance \nmisuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, \nif indicated. Persons who inject drugs should be encouraged \nto take the following additional steps to reduce personal and \npublic health risks:\n• Never reuse or share syringes, water, or drug preparation \nequipment.\n• Only use syringes obtained from a reliable source (e.g., a \nsyringe services program or a pharmacy).\n• Use a new, sterile syringe to prepare and inject drugs each time.\n• If possible, use sterile water to prepare drugs; otherwise, \nuse clean water from a reliable source (e.g., fresh tap water).\n• Use a new or disinfected container (i.e., cooker) and a new \nfilter (i.e., cotton) to prepare drugs.\n• Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab before \ninjection.\n• Safely dispose of syringes after one use.\nPostexposure Follow-Up\nNo PEP has been demonstrated to be effective against HCV \ninfection. T esting for HCV is recommended for health care \nworkers after percutaneous or perimucosal exposures to HCV-\npositive blood. Prompt identification of acute infection is vital \nbecause outcomes are improved when treatment is initiated \nearly during the illness course.\nSpecial Considerations\nPregnancy\nAll pregnant women should be screened with each pregnancy \nfor HCV antibodies at the first prenatal visit in settings \nwhere the HCV prevalence is >0.1% (https://www.cdc.gov/\nhepatitis/hcv/index.htm ) ( 154,155). Although the rate of \ntransmission is highly variable, more than six of every 100 \ninfants born to women with HCV infection become infected; \nthis infection occurs predominantly during or near delivery, \nand no treatment or delivery method (e.g., cesarean delivery) \nhas been demonstrated to decrease this risk (1375). However, \nthe risk is increased by the presence of maternal HCV viremia \nat delivery and is twofold to threefold greater if the woman has \nHIV infection. Although no recommendations are available \nfor HCV treatment during pregnancy, discussion about the \nindividual risks and benefits of postpartum treatment can be \nconsidered in accordance with existing guidance (https://www.\nhcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/pregnancy).\nHCV has not been reported to be transmitted through breast \nmilk, although mothers with HCV infection should consider \nabstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or \nbleeding. Infants born to mothers with HCV infection should \nbe tested for HCV infection; children should be tested for \nanti-HCV no sooner than age 18 months because anti-HCV \nfrom the mother might last until that age.

The course of liver \ndisease is more rapid among persons with HIV and HCV , and \nthe risk for cirrhosis is higher than that for persons with HCV \ninfection alone.\nProctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis\nSexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include \nproctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis. Evaluation for these \nsyndromes should include recommended diagnostic \nprocedures, including anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, stool \nexamination for WBCs, and microbiologic workup (e.g., \ngonorrhea, chlamydia [LGV PCR if available], herpes simplex \nNAAT , and syphilis serology). For those with enteritis, stool \nculture or LGV PCR also is recommended.\nProctitis is inflammation of the rectum (i.e., the distal \n10–12 cm) that can be associated with anorectal pain, \ntenesmus, or rectal discharge. Fecal leukocytes are common. \nProctitis occurs predominantly among persons who have \nreceptive anal exposures (oral-anal, digital-anal, or genital-\nanal). N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis (including LGV serovars), \nHSV , and T . pallidum are the most common STI pathogens. \nGenital HSV and LGV proctitis are more prevalent among \npersons with HIV infection ( 545,556,1382). M. genitalium \nhas been detected in certain cases of proctitis and might be \nmore common among persons with HIV infection (937,1382). \nN. meningitidis has been identified as an etiology of proctitis \namong MSM with HIV infection (1383).\nProctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis, \ndiarrhea or abdominal cramps, and inflammation of the colonic \nmucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus. Fecal leukocytes \nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \npathogen. Proctocolitis can be acquired through receptive anal \nintercourse or by oral-anal contact, depending on the pathogen.\nPathogenic organisms include Campylobacter species, \nShigella species, E. histolytica, LGV serovars of C. trachomatis, \nand T . pallidum. Among immunosuppressed persons with \nHIV infection, CMV or other opportunistic agents should \nbe considered. The clinical presentation can be mistaken for \ninflammatory bowel disease or malignancy, resulting in a \ndelayed diagnosis (1384,1385).\nEnteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping \nwithout signs of proctitis or proctocolitis. Fecal leukocytes \nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \npathogen. When outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness occur \namong social or sexual networks of MSM, clinicians should \nconsider sexual transmission as a mode of spread and provide \ncounseling accordingly. Sexual practices that can facilitate \ntransmission of enteric pathogens include oral-anal contact or, \nin certain instances, direct genital-anal contact. G. lamblia is the \nmost frequently implicated parasite, and bacterial pathogens \ninclude Shigella species, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter \nspecies, and Cryptosporidium. Outbreaks of Shigella species, \nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and microsporidiosis have \nbeen reported among MSM (259,274,1386,1387).

Multiple stool \nexaminations might be necessary for detecting Giardia , \nand special stool preparations are required for diagnosing \ncryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. Diagnostic and \ntreatment recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond \nthe scope of these guidelines.

Pediculosis pubis is \ncaused by the parasite Phthirus pubis and is usually transmitted \nby sexual contact (1393).\nDiagnosis\nThe clinical diagnosis is based on typical symptoms of itching \nin the pubic region. Lice and nits can be observed on pubic hair.\nTreatment\nRecommended Regimens for Pediculosis Pubis\nPermethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off \nafter 10 minutes\nor\nPyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and \nwashed off after 10 minutes\nAlternative Regimens\nMalathion 0.5% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after \n8–12 hours\nor\nIvermectin 250 µg/kg body weight orally, repeated in 7–14 days\nReported resistance to pediculicides (permethrin and \npyrethrin) has been increasing and is widespread (1394,1395). \nMalathion can be used when treatment failure is believed to \nhave occurred as a result of resistance. The odor and longer \nduration of application associated with malathion therapy \nmake it a less attractive alternative compared with the \nrecommended pediculicides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal \nactivity ( 1396). Ivermectin might not prevent recurrences \nfrom eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment \nshould be repeated in 7–14 days ( 1397,1398). Ivermectin \nshould be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, \nthus increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. \nAdjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons \nwith renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses \namong persons with severe liver disease is unknown. Lindane \nis not recommended for treatment of pediculosis because of \ntoxicity, contraindications for certain populations (pregnant \nand breastfeeding women, children aged <10 years, and those \nwith extensive dermatitis), and complexity of administration.\nOther Management Considerations\nThe recommended regimens should not be applied to the \neyes. Pediculosis of the eyelashes should be treated by applying \nocclusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid \nmargins 2 times/day for 10 days. Bedding and clothing should \nbe decontaminated (i.e., machine washed and dried by using \nthe heat cycle or dry cleaned) or removed from body contact \nfor at least 72 hours. Fumigation of living areas is unnecessary. \nPubic hair removal has been associated with atypical patterns \nof pubic lice infestation and decreasing incidence of infection \n(537,1399). Persons with pediculosis pubis should be evaluated \nfor HIV , syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.\nFollow-Up\nEvaluation should be performed after 1 week if symptoms \npersist. Retreatment might be necessary if lice are found or \nif eggs are observed at the hair-skin junction. If no clinical \nresponse is achieved to one of the recommended regimens, \nretreatment with an alternative regimen is recommended.\nManagement of Sex Partners\nSex partners within the previous month should be treated. \nSexual contact should be avoided until patients and partners \nhave been treated, bedding and clothing decontaminated, and \nreevaluation performed to rule out persistent infection.\nSpecial Considerations\nPregnancy\nExisting data from human participants demonstrate that \npregnant and lactating women should be treated with either \npermethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide.

Choice of \ntreatment might be based on patient preference for topical \nversus oral therapy, drug interactions with ivermectin (e.g., \nazithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim], or \ncetirizine [Zytrec]), and cost. Permethrin is safe and effective \nwith a single application (1411). Ivermectin has limited ovicidal \nactivity and might not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time \nof treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be \nadministered 14 days after the first dose ( 1412). Ivermectin \nshould be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, \nthereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. \nAdjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required for patients \nwith renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses \namong patients with severe liver disease is unknown.\nLindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity \n(1413); it should be used only if the patient cannot tolerate \nthe recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed \n(1414–1416). Lindane is not recommended for pregnant and \nbreastfeeding women, children aged <10 years, and persons \nwith extensive dermatitis. Seizures have occurred when lindane \nwas applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive \ndermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been \nreported (1413). Lindane resistance has been reported in some \nareas of the world, including parts of the United States (1413).\nOther Management Considerations\nBedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., \neither machine washed and dried by using the heat cycle or \ndry cleaned) or removed from body contact for >72 hours. \nFumigation of living areas is unnecessary.

Lindane should be avoided because of the risks \nfor neurotoxicity with heavy applications on denuded skin.\nFollow-Up\nThe rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for <2 weeks \nafter treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for >2 weeks \ncan be attributed to multiple factors. T reatment failure \ncan occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty \napplication of topical scabicides.

Those identified as being \ninfested should be provided treatment.\nManagement of Outbreaks in Communities, \nNursing Homes, and Other Institutional Settings\nScabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing homes, \nhospitals, residential facilities, and other communities \n(1420,1421). Control of an epidemic can only be achieved \nby treating the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be \nconsidered in these settings, especially if treatment with topical \nscabicides fails. Mass treatment with oral ivermectin is highly \neffective in decreasing prevalence in settings where scabies is \nendemic (1422). Epidemics should be managed in consultation \nwith a specialist.\nSpecial Considerations\nInfants, Young Children, and Pregnant or \nLactating Women\nInfants and young children should be treated with \npermethrin; the safety of ivermectin for children weighing \n<15 kg has not been determined. Infants and children aged \n<10 years should not be treated with lindane. Ivermectin likely \nposes a low risk to pregnant women and is likely compatible \nwith breastfeeding; however, because of limited data regarding \nivermectin use for pregnant and lactating women, permethrin \nis the preferred treatment (431) (see Pediculosis Pubis).\nHIV Infection\nPersons with HIV infection who have uncomplicated scabies \nshould receive the same treatment regimens as those who do \nnot have HIV . Persons with HIV infection and others who are \nimmunosuppressed are at increased risk for crusted scabies and \nshould be managed in consultation with a specialist.\nSexual Assault and Abuse and STIs\nAdolescents and Adults\nThese guidelines are primarily limited to the identification, \nprophylaxis, and treatment of STIs and conditions among \nadolescent and adult female sexual assault survivors. However, \nsome of the following guidelines might still apply to male \nsexual assault survivors. Documentation of findings, collection \nof nonmicrobiologic specimens for forensic purposes, \nand management of potential pregnancy or physical and \npsychological trauma are beyond the scope of these guidelines. \nExaminations of survivors of sexual assault should be \nconducted by an experienced clinician in a way that minimizes \nfurther trauma to the person. The decision to obtain genital \nor other specimens for STI diagnosis should be made on an \nindividual basis. Care systems for survivors should be designed \nto ensure continuity, including timely review of test results, \nsupport adherence, and monitoring for adverse reactions to \nany prescribed therapeutic or prophylactic regimens. Laws in \nall 50 states limit the evidentiary use of a survivor’s previous \nsexual history, including evidence of previously acquired STIs, \nas part of an effort to undermine the credibility of the survivor’s \ntestimony. Evidentiary privilege against revealing any aspect of \nthe examination or treatment also is enforced in most states. \nAlthough it rarely occurs, STI diagnoses might later be accessed, \nand the survivor and clinician might opt to defer testing for this \nreason. Although collection of specimens at initial examination \nfor laboratory STI diagnosis gives the survivor and clinician \nthe option of deferring empiric prophylactic antimicrobial \ntreatment, compliance with follow-up visits is typically poor \n(1423–1425).

For survivors who \nare treated during the initial visit, regardless of whether testing \nwas performed, posttreatment testing should be conducted \nonly if the person reports having symptoms. If initial test results \nwere negative and infection in the assailant cannot be ruled \nout, serologic tests for syphilis can be repeated at 4–6 weeks \nand 3 months; HIV testing can be repeated at 6 weeks and at \n3 months by using methods to identify acute HIV infection.\nRisk for Acquiring HIV Infection\nHIV seroconversion has occurred among persons whose only \nknown risk factor was sexual assault or sexual abuse; however, \nthe frequency of this occurrence likely is low (1428,1429). In \nconsensual sex, the per-act risk for HIV transmission from \nvaginal intercourse is 0.08%, and for receptive anal intercourse, \n1.38% (192). The per-act risk for HIV transmission from \noral sex is substantially lower. Specific circumstances of an \nassault (e.g., bleeding, which often accompanies trauma) \nmight increase risk for HIV transmission in cases involving \nvaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Site of exposure to ejaculate, \nviral load in ejaculate, and the presence of an STI or genital \nlesions in the assailant or survivor also might increase risk for \nHIV acquisition.\nPEP with a 28-day course of zidovudine was associated with \nan 81% reduction in risk for acquiring HIV in a study of health \ncare workers who had percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected \nblood (1430). On the basis of these results and results from \nanimal studies, PEP has been recommended for health care \nworkers who have occupational exposures to HIV ( 1431). \nThese findings have been extrapolated to nonoccupational \ninjecting drug and sexual HIV exposures, including sexual \nassault. The possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should \nbe assessed at the initial examination; survivors determined \nto be at risk for acquiring HIV should be informed about the \npossible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection. Initiation \nof PEP as soon as possible after the exposure increases the \nlikelihood of prophylactic benefit.\nMultiple factors affect the medical recommendation for \nPEP and affect the assault survivor’s acceptance of that \nrecommendation. These factors include the likelihood of the \nassailant having HIV , any exposure characteristics that might \nincrease the risk for HIV transmission, the time elapsed after \nthe event, and the potential benefits and risks associated \nwith PEP ( 1431). Determination of the assailant’s HIV \nstatus at the time of the postassault examination is usually \nnot possible. Therefore, health care providers should assess \nany available information concerning the characteristics and \nHIV risk behaviors of the assailant (e.g., being an MSM or \nusing injecting drugs), local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, and \nexposure characteristics of the assault. When an assailant’s \nHIV status is unknown, determinations about risk for HIV \ntransmission to the survivor should be based on whether vaginal \nor anal penetration occurred; whether ejaculation occurred on \nmucous membranes; whether multiple assailants were involved; \nwhether mucosal lesions were present in the assailant or \nsurvivor; and any other characteristics of the assault, survivor, \nor assailant that might increase risk for HIV transmission.\nIf PEP is offered, the following information should be \ndiscussed with the survivor: the necessity of early initiation \nof PEP to optimize potential benefits (i.e., as soon as possible \nafter and <72 hours after the assault), the importance of close", "n_chars": 4558, "n_tokens_est": 1139, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.783799Z"}

Clinical management of the \nsurvivor should be implemented according to the HIV PEP \nguidelines and in collaboration with specialists (1436).

The importance of\nRecommendations and Reports\n132 MMWR / July 23, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 4\nUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nidentifying a sexually transmitted organism for such children \nas evidence of possible child sexual abuse varies by pathogen. \nPostnatally acquired gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and \nT . vaginalis infection and nontransfusion, nonperinatally \nacquired HIV infection are indicative of sexual abuse. \nSexual abuse should be suspected when anogenital herpes or \nanogenital warts are diagnosed. Investigation of sexual abuse \namong children who have an infection that might have been \ntransmitted sexually should be conducted in compliance with \nrecommendations by clinicians who have experience and \ntraining in all elements of the evaluation of child abuse, neglect, \nand assault. The social significance of an infection that might \nhave been acquired sexually varies by the specific organism, as \ndoes the threshold for reporting suspected child sexual abuse \n(Table 8). When any STI has been diagnosed in a child, efforts \nshould be made in consultation with a specialist to evaluate \nthe possibility of sexual abuse, including conducting a history \nand physical examination for evidence of abuse and diagnostic \ntesting for other commonly occurring STIs (1439–1441).\nThe general rule that STIs beyond the neonatal period are \nevidence of sexual abuse has exceptions. For example, genital \ninfection with T . vaginalis (1442) or rectal or genital infection \nwith C. trachomatis among young children might be the result \nof perinatally acquired infection and has, in certain cases \nof chlamydial infection, persisted for as long as 2–3 years \n(1443–1445), although perinatal chlamydial infection is now \nuncommon because of prenatal screening and treatment of \npregnant women. Genital warts have been diagnosed among \nchildren who have been sexually abused ( 1426) but also \namong children who have no other evidence of sexual abuse \n(1446,1447); lesions appearing for the first time in a child \naged >5 years are more likely to have been caused by sexual \ntransmission (1448). BV has been diagnosed among children \nwho have been abused but its presence alone does not prove \nsexual abuse. The majority of HBV infections among children \nresult from household exposure to persons who have chronic \nHBV infection rather than sexual abuse.\nReporting\nAll U.S. states and territories have laws that require reporting \nof child abuse. Although the exact requirements differ by state \nor territory, if a health care provider has reasonable cause to \nsuspect child abuse, a report must be made (1448). Health care \nproviders should contact their state or local child protection \nservice agency regarding child abuse reporting requirements.\nEvaluating Children for STIs\nEvaluating children for sexual assault or abuse should be \nconducted in a manner designed to minimize pain and trauma \nto the child. Examinations and collection of vaginal specimens \nin prepubertal girls can be extremely uncomfortable and should \nbe performed by an experienced clinician to avoid psychological \nand physical trauma to the child. The decision to obtain genital \nor other specimens from a child to evaluate for STIs should be \nmade on an individual basis. However, children who received \na diagnosis of one STI should be screened for other STIs. \nHistory and reported type of sexual contact might not be a \nreliable indicator, and urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal testing \nshould be considered for preverbal children and children who \ncannot verbalize details of the assault (1438,1449). Factors that \nshould lead the physician to consider testing for STIs include \nthe following (1449):\n• The child has experienced penetration or has evidence of \nrecent or healed penetrative injury to the genitals, anus, \nor oropharynx.\n• The child has been abused by a stranger.", "n_chars": 4502, "n_tokens_est": 1125, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.783987Z"}

Because of the legal and \npsychosocial consequences of a false-positive diagnosis, only \ntests with high specificities should be used. The potential \nbenefit to the child of a reliable STI diagnosis justifies deferring \npresumptive treatment until specimens for highly specific tests \nare obtained by providers with experience in evaluating sexually \nabused and assaulted children.\nEvaluations should be performed on a case-by-case basis, \naccording to history of assault or abuse and in a manner \nthat minimizes the possibility for psychological trauma and \nsocial stigma. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious \norganisms acquired through the exposure might not have \nproduced sufficient concentrations to result in positive test \nresults or examination findings (1450). Alternatively, positive \ntest results after a recent exposure might represent the assailant’s \nsecretions (but would nonetheless be an indication for \ntreatment of the child). A second visit approximately 2–6 weeks \nafter the most recent sexual exposure should be scheduled \nto include a repeat physical examination and collection of \nadditional specimens to identify any infection that might not \nhave been detected at the time of initial evaluation. A single \nevaluation might be sufficient if the child was abused for an \nextended period and if a substantial amount of time elapsed \nbetween the last suspected episode of abuse and the medical \nevaluation. Compliance with follow-up appointments might be \nimproved when law enforcement personnel or child protective \nservices are involved.\nInitial Examination\nVisual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas \nfor genital discharge, odor, bleeding, irritation, warts, \nand ulcerative lesions should be performed during initial \nexamination. The clinical manifestations of certain STIs are \ndifferent for children than for adults. For example, typical \nvesicular lesions might be absent even in the presence of HSV \ninfection. The following should be performed during the initial \nexamination, if STI testing is indicated:\n• T esting for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can be \nperformed from specimens collected from the pharynx \nand rectum, as well as the vagina for girls and urine for \nboys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for \nprepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a \nmeatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for \nan intraurethral swab specimen.

Decisions \nregarding the infectious agents for which to perform \nserologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.\nTreatment\nThe risk for a child acquiring an STI as a result of sexual \nabuse or assault has not been well studied. Presumptive \ntreatment for children who have been sexually assaulted or \nabused is not recommended because the incidence of most \nSTIs among children is low after abuse or assault, prepubertal \ngirls appear to be at lower risk for ascending infection than \nadolescent or adult women, and regular follow-up of children \nusually can be ensured. However, certain children or their \nparent or guardian might be concerned about the possibility \nof infection with an STI, even if the health care provider \nhas perceived the risk to be low. Such concerns might be an \nindication for presumptive treatment in certain settings and \nmight be considered after all relevant specimens for diagnostic \ntests have been collected.\nOther Management Considerations\nChildren who are survivors of sexual assault or abuse are at \nincreased risk for future unsafe sexual practices that have been \nlinked to higher risk for HPV acquisition ( 1426,1453) and \nare more likely to engage in these behaviors at an earlier age; \ntherefore, ACIP recommends vaccination of these children \nat age ≥9 years if they have not initiated or completed HPV \nvaccination (see Human Papillomavirus Infections, Prevention) \n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/\nhpv.html). Although HPV vaccine will not protect against \nprogression of infection already acquired or promote clearance \nof the infection, the vaccine protects against HPV types not \nyet acquired.\nFollow-Up\nIf no infections were identified at the initial examination \nafter the last suspected sexual exposure, and if this exposure \nwas recent, a follow-up evaluation approximately 2 weeks \nafter the last exposure can be considered. Likewise, if no \nphysical examination or diagnostic testing was performed \nat the initial visit, a complete examination can be scheduled \napproximately 2 weeks after the last exposure to identify any \nevidence of STIs.

(\nView PDF\nView Summary Chart\n) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Endorsed December 2024)\nSummary\nThe 2024 U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (U.S. MEC) comprises recommendations for the use of specific contraceptive methods by persons who have certain characteristics or medical conditions. These recommendations for health care providers were updated by CDC after review of the scientific evidence and a meeting with national experts in Atlanta, Georgia, during January 25–27, 2023. The information in this report replaces the 2016 U.S. MEC (CDC. U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016. MMWR 2016:65[No. RR-3]:1–103). Notable updates include 1) the addition of recommendations for persons with chronic kidney disease; 2) revisions to the recommendations for persons with certain characteristics or medical conditions (i.e., breastfeeding, postpartum, postabortion, obesity, surgery, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with or without anticoagulant therapy, thrombophilia, superficial venous thrombosis, valvular heart disease, peripartum cardiomyopathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, high risk for HIV infection, cirrhosis, liver tumor, sickle cell disease, solid organ transplantation, and drug interactions with antiretrovirals used for prevention or treatment of HIV infection); and 3) inclusion of new contraceptive methods, including new doses or formulations of combined oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, vaginal rings, progestin-only pills, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, and vaginal pH modulator. The recommendations in this report are intended to serve as a source of evidence-based clinical practice guidance for health care providers. The goals of these recommendations are to remove unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception and to support the provision of person-centered contraceptive counseling and services in a noncoercive manner. Health care providers should always consider the individual clinical circumstances of each person seeking contraceptive services. This report is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice for individual patients; when needed, patients should seek advice from their health care providers about contraceptive use.\nU.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2024\n.

These recommendations for health care providers were updated by CDC after review of the scientific evidence and a meeting with national experts in Atlanta, Georgia, during January 25–27, 2023. The information in this report replaces the 2016 U.S. SPR (CDC. U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2016. MMWR 2016;65[No. RR-4]:1–66). Notable updates include 1) updated recommendations for provision of medications for intrauterine device placement, 2) updated recommendations for bleeding irregularities during implant use, 3) new recommendations for testosterone use and risk for pregnancy, and 4) new recommendations for self-administration of injectable contraception. The recommendations in this report are intended to serve as a source of evidence based clinical practice guidance for health care providers. The goals of these recommendations are to remove unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception and to support the provision of person-centered contraceptive counseling and services in a noncoercive manner. Health care providers should always consider the individual clinical circumstances of each person seeking contraceptive services.

The panels included civilian and military anthrax experts and clinicians with experience treating anthrax patients. Specialties represented included internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, critical care, pulmonology, hematology, and nephrology. Panelists discussed recent patients with systemic anthrax; reviews of published, unpublished, and proprietary data regarding antimicrobial drugs and anthrax antitoxins; and critical care measures of potential benefit to patients with anthrax. This article updates antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis and antimicrobial and antitoxin treatment options and describes potentially beneficial critical care measures for persons with anthrax, including clinical procedures for infected nonpregnant adults. Changes from previous guidelines include an expanded discussion of critical care and clinical procedures and additional antimicrobial choices, including preferred antimicrobial drug treatment for possible anthrax meningitis.\nAnthrax has been recognized as an infectious disease of animals and humans for millennia. Within the United States, animal anthrax is reported in most years, but naturally occurring human anthrax is rare. Worldwide, however, the disease is common in wild and domestic animals and not uncommon among persons who interact with animals in agricultural regions of South and Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, central and southwestern Asia, and southern and eastern Europe (\n). Biodefense experts often place\nBacillus anthracis\nat or near the top of the list for potential threat agents. Inhalation anthrax is particularly deadly, as demonstrated by the 1979 accidental release of\nB. anthracis\nfrom a military microbiology facility in the Sverdlovsk region of Russia; 88% (66/75) of patients reported with inhalation anthrax died (\n). More recently, humans have acquired disease from exposure to spores released purposefully as a bioterrorist weapon (\n) and accidentally from naturally occurring sources (\n).\nMethods\nIn early 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) invited persons from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and university medical centers with expertise in anthrax and critical care medicine to develop an agenda and a list of potential expert panelists to revise the current guidance for prevention and treatment of anthrax. In October 2011 and March 2012, CDC held subject matter–expert panel meetings to review available scientific information and update previous guidelines for prevention and treatment of anthrax. Meeting attendees (see end of article) included clinicians with experience caring for the most recently hospitalized patients with naturally occurring cases of inhalation, gastrointestinal, or injection anthrax and academic and federal civilian and military researchers with anthrax expertise. Specialties represented included internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, critical care, pulmonology, hematology, and nephrology.", "n_chars": 4340, "n_tokens_est": 1085, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.838752Z"}

Specialties represented included internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, critical care, pulmonology, hematology, and nephrology.\nAt the meetings, attendees reviewed data from published literature on human anthrax case reports, human and animal clinical trials, anthrax prevention and treatment, and unpublished antitoxin efficacy and safety data. Workgroups were formed to address clinical management, antimicrobial drug use, and antitoxin use. The workgroups drafted changes to previous guidelines, vetted them before the expert panel, and reached general agreement. After the meeting, workgroup members further refined the proposed changes by teleconference and email exchanges. The final draft was distributed to all meeting participants for review and comment. This article summarizes the presentations and discussions of the meeting and updates previous CDC guidelines for prevention and treatment of anthrax in nonpregnant adults.\nPathogenesis\nB. anthracis\n, the causative agent of anthrax, is a nonmotile spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. The spores of\nB. anthracis\n, which can remain dormant in the environment for decades, are the infectious form, but vegetative\nB. anthracis\nrarely causes disease (\n). Spores introduced through the skin lead to cutaneous or injection anthrax; those introduced through the gastrointestinal tract lead to gastrointestinal anthrax; and those introduced through the lungs lead to inhalation anthrax. After entering a human or animal,\nB. anthracis\nspores are believed to germinate locally or be transported by phagocytic cells to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes, where they germinate; or both (\n).\nB. anthracis\nbegins producing toxins within hours of germination (\n). Protective antigen (PA) and edema factor (EF) combine to form edema toxin (ET) and PA and lethal factor (LF) combine to form lethal toxin (LT). After binding to surface receptors, the PA portion of the complexes facilitates translocation of the toxins to the cytosol, in which EF and LF exert their toxic effects (\n).\nThe toxins have several physiologic effects. In sedated and mechanically ventilated dogs challenged with 24-h LT infusions to simulate release during anthrax infection, the toxin produced gradual but progressive hypotension associated with reductions in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular ejection fraction that persisted for ≤72 h (\n). Similar challenges with ET produced rapid hypotension associated with sharp and persistent decreases in central venous pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Such changes suggest that both toxins alter the peripheral vasculature, but that LT might also have a direct effect on depressing myocardial function, and ET causes venous and arterial relaxation. Both toxins were associated with progressive renal and hepatic dysfunction because of direct toxic effects or secondarily to hypoperfusion (\n).\nGross pathologic lesions observed in non-human primates (NHPs) used in aerosol challenge models of inhalation anthrax include edema, congestion, hemorrhage, and necrosis in the lungs and mediastinum. Splenitis and necrotizing or hemorrhagic lymphadenitis involving the mediastinal, tracheobronchial, and other lymph nodes are common (\n10\n). Primary pulmonary lesions, including those of pneumonia, are occasionally observed. Meningeal involvement ranging from edema, congestion, hemorrhage, and necrosis to suppurative or hemorrhagic meningitis, usually secondary to hematogenous spread from other types of anthrax, occurs in ≤77% of animals studied (\n10\n). Autopsy findings for persons who died from inhalation anthrax in Sverdlovsk and in the United States (\n) are consistent with findings from the NHP studies. Persons who died had extensive amounts of serosanguinous fluid in pleural cavities and edema and hemorrhage of the mediastinum and surrounding soft tissues, and 48% had cerebral edema, 21% had ascites, 17% had pericardial effusions, and 14% had petechial rash. Mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen also showed hemorrhage and necrosis (\n11\n12\n).\nCritical Care Measures and Procedures\nEvaluation", "n_chars": 4583, "n_tokens_est": 1145, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.838813Z"}

Mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen also showed hemorrhage and necrosis (\n11\n12\n).\nCritical Care Measures and Procedures\nEvaluation\nEarly diagnosis of anthrax and initiation of appropriate treatment, particularly administration of a combination of antimicrobial drugs, are critical to improving survival. After treatment, uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has a mortality rate of <2%. However, even with antimicrobial drug treatment and modern critical care, injection, gastrointestinal, and inhalation anthrax have mortality rates of 28% (\n13\n), ≥40% (\n14\n); and 45% (\n15\n), respectively. Anthrax meningitis is nearly always fatal, even with treatment (\n16\n). Many patients with cutaneous anthrax can be treated as outpatients. However, patients with symptoms or signs of systemic involvement (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, hyperthermia, hypothermia, leukocytosis) or with lesions that involve the head, neck, or upper torso or that are large, bullous, multiple, or surrounded by edema, have higher mortality rates (\n17\n). Hospitalization is warranted for all patients with systemic cutaneous anthrax; gastrointestinal, injection, or inhalation anthrax; or anthrax meningitis or bacteremia.\nInitial evaluation of patients suspected of having anthrax (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 1) should be similar to the standard evaluation for patients with an acute febrile illness and should have an emphasis on obtaining pretreatment blood and other appropriate cultures. However, failure to fulfill systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria should not decrease concern for sepsis because patients with systemic anthrax might not initially appear critically ill. Inhalation anthrax can have a prodromal phase followed by a fulminant phase (\n). Patients with systemic anthrax have had debilitating symptoms, followed first by transitory improvement and then by precipitous hemodynamic deterioration (\n18\n). Because of this potential for sudden decompensation, hospitalized patients should have careful hemodynamic monitoring, including continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 1). Chest computed tomography might be needed to identify the characteristic widened mediastinum and pleural effusions as well as common that are inapparent on chest radiographs (e.g., pericardial effusion). Unless contraindicated, lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out meningitis.\nHemodynamic Support\nDespite potential pathophysiologic differences between\nB. anthracis\nseptic shock and septic shock caused by other bacteria, standard sepsis and septic shock guidelines should be followed for anthraz patients, including guidelines for fluids, vasopressors, blood products, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring (\n19\n). Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage commonly occur with anthrax infections; these complications must be aggressively managed, and might pose contraindications to invasive central catheter placement. Fresh frozen plasma and plasmapheresis should be considered, and fibrinogen levels should be kept >100 mg/dL. Because of the risk for coagulopathy, mechanical rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis is preferred for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. An echocardiogram might be needed to identify pericardial effusions, as reported for 3 of 10 patients (postal workers) with inhalation anthrax in 2001 (\n).\nMechanical Ventilation\nIn addition to the need for mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress or airway protection for persons with altered mental status, some patients with anthrax might require respiratory support for airway edema. Substantial edema with fatal outcome can occur with cutaneous lesions involving the head, neck, or thorax, and with oropharyngeal lesions (\n20\n). Thus, aggressive monitoring for airway compromise is warranted in patients with such lesions.\nIn inhalation anthrax, although respiratory failure is more consistent with reaccumulating pleural effusions than with adult respiratory distress syndrome, standard mechanical ventilator principles apply (\n21", "n_chars": 4544, "n_tokens_est": 1136, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.838892Z"}

Thus, aggressive monitoring for airway compromise is warranted in patients with such lesions.\nIn inhalation anthrax, although respiratory failure is more consistent with reaccumulating pleural effusions than with adult respiratory distress syndrome, standard mechanical ventilator principles apply (\n21\n). Airway pressures may be difficult to interpret if there is loss of pulmonary compliance from excessive chest wall edema or restriction by pleural or peritoneal effusions. The need for ventilation in some patients and the duration of ventilation in others may be reduced by pleural space drainage.\nAdjunctive Corticosteroids\nThere are no randomized trials of corticosteroid use for human anthrax and no animal data that support its use. However, several small observational studies of adjunctive corticosteroids for cutaneous anthrax of the head and neck appear to favor their use in such situations (\n22\n23\n). Although there are also limited data on steroid use for documented anthrax meningitis, adjunctive intravenous dexamethasone is the standard of care for patients with suspected bacterial meningitis and should be started at the time of initial antimicrobial drug therapy to prevent neurologic sequelae (\n24\n). Several survivors (postal workers) in 2001 received corticosteroids for nonanthrax indications (\n). On the basis of available evidence and absence of apparent side effects unique to treatment for systemic anthrax, adjunctive corticosteroids should be considered in patients who had a history of use of endocrine or corticosteroid therapy; edema, especially of the head or neck; evidence of anthrax meningitis; or vasopressor-resistant shock (\n16\n25\n).\nProcedures and Surgical Interventions\nHigh LF concentrations have been detected in pleural fluid (\n) and in ascites (A. Boyer, unpub. data) from patients with inhalation anthrax. In addition, pleural fluid drainage has been positively associated with survival in a large case series (\n26\n). Drainage of pleural fluid and ascites is believed to improve survival by reducing the toxin level and by decreasing mechanical lung compression. These data support the need for early and aggressive drainage of any clinically or radiographically apparent pleural effusions; chest tube drainage is recommended over thoracentesis because many effusions will require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated collections. Ascites should also be drained and monitored for reaccumulation; continuous drainage might be required.\nSurgery might be contraindicated or indicated, depending on the type of anthrax. Surgery for cutaneous anthrax can lead to dissemination and poor outcome. Surgery is contraindicated for acute disease, with the exception of tracheotomy for airway obstruction and surgical intervention for large or circumferential extremity lesions causing compartment syndrome. Surgery may be indicated for gastrointestinal anthrax to identify and address potentially fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation (\n27\n). For injection anthrax, surgery is used to obtain diagnostic specimens to differentiate the infection from necrotizing fasciitis and to remove the necrotic nidus of infection, which may be a toxin and spore reservoir. Surgery for injection anthrax should be more limited than that for necrotizing fasciitis, and resection should be performed only to healthy tissue. Compression of soft tissues can be released by incision, excision, or fasciotomy and might be required for treatment of compartment syndrome (\n28\n). Diathermy dissection is advised to optimize hemostasis.\nAntimicrobial Selection Considerations for Prevention and Treatment\nThe approach to prevention and treatment of anthrax differs from that for other bacterial infections. The production of toxin, potential for antimicrobial drug resistance, frequent occurrence of meningitis, and presence of latent spores must be taken into account when selecting postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) or a combination of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of anthrax. In addition, most data on which these antimicrobial drug options are based predate the availability of many of the antimicrobial drugs discussed and are drawn from limited animal studies.", "n_chars": 4595, "n_tokens_est": 1148, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.838949Z"}

The production of toxin, potential for antimicrobial drug resistance, frequent occurrence of meningitis, and presence of latent spores must be taken into account when selecting postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) or a combination of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of anthrax. In addition, most data on which these antimicrobial drug options are based predate the availability of many of the antimicrobial drugs discussed and are drawn from limited animal studies.\nAmong patients with inhalation anthrax during 1900–2005, antimicrobial drug combination therapy was more likely to be curative than antimicrobial drug monotherapy (\n26\n). There is also a theoretical benefit for combined use of bactericidal and protein synthesis inhibitor agents. Bactericidal agents have immediate killing effect. However, the high rates of illness and death seen with anthrax are caused, in part, by\nB. anthracis\nexotoxin production. In vitro toxin production is inhibited earlier by protein synthesis inhibitors than by bactericidal agents (\n29\n); this characteristic is associated with clinical benefit in streptococcal toxic shock and clostridial sepsis. Combination antimicrobial drug regimens were used in all 8 survivors of inhalation anthrax during 2001–2012; five survivors were also treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor (\n26\n30\n). Patients hospitalized for systemic anthrax should be immediately treated with a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial drug treatment pending confirmatory test results because any delay may prove fatal.\nNaturally occurring\nB. anthracis\nhas variable β-lactam resistance, particularly to cephalosporins (\n31\n). Thus, cephalosporins are contraindicated. In addition, multidrug resistance in naturally occurring\nB. anthracis\ninfection has been reported (\n32\n) and can be induced in vitro (\n33\n). This finding increases concern that a\nB. anthracis\nstrain could be resistant to ≥1 recommended antimicrobial drug options or that use of β-lactams for a strain that was originally β-lactam susceptible could lead to development of β-lactam-resistance during prophylaxis, if adherence to treatment is poor, as was observed among postal workers in 2001 (\n34\n). Another concern is that β-lactam use could induce resistance during treatment, especially with the high bacterial loads characteristic of systemic anthrax. Thus, penicillin-based antimicrobial drug use requires a high index of suspicion for emergence of resistance.\nMeningitis and hemorrhagic brain parenchymal infection has been observed in ≤50% of human anthrax cases (\n16\n26\n). Thus, meningitis must be considered in all cases of systemic anthrax, and antimicrobial drugs used to treat possible meningitis must have good penetration of the central nervous system (CNS).\nThe presence of a spore form of\nB. anthracis\nrequires prolonged antimicrobial drug prophylaxis. Incubation periods ≤43 days have been observed in humans (\n) and 58 days in NHPs (\n35\n), and viable spores have been detected in lungs of NHPs for ≤100 days after aerosol exposures (\n36\n). Thus, persons exposed to aerosolized\nB. anthracis\nare presumed to be at risk for inhalation anthrax from ungerminated spores retained in their lungs after the initial exposure, including patients treated for any form of anthrax who were exposed to aerosolized spores. In addition, if antimicrobial drug treatment is initiated soon after exposure, animal studies suggest the acquired immune response might be blunted and not be protective (\n35\n). This finding suggests the need to continue antimicrobial drug therapy for 60 days to clear germinating organisms.\nAnthrax Prevention\nWell-timed and effective PEP can potentially save thousands of lives (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 2). PEP of asymptomatic persons should ideally start as soon as possible after exposure because its effectiveness decreases with delay in implementation. In 2009, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 60 days of antimicrobial drug prophylaxis for immediate protection and a 3-dose series of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) BioThrax (Emergent Biosolutions Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) for long-term protection after exposure to anthrax (\n37\n). To ensure adequate and continued protection, everyone exposed to aerosolized\nB. anthracis\nspores should receive a full 60 days of PEP antimicrobial drugs, whether they are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated.\nAntimicrobial Drugs", "n_chars": 4578, "n_tokens_est": 1144, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.839019Z"}

To ensure adequate and continued protection, everyone exposed to aerosolized\nB. anthracis\nspores should receive a full 60 days of PEP antimicrobial drugs, whether they are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated.\nAntimicrobial Drugs\nCiprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and doxycycline are FDA-approved for the antimicrobial drug portion of PEP for inhalation anthrax in adults ≥18 years of age. No safety data are available for levofloxacin use beyond 30 days; thus, oral ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are recommended as first-line antimicrobial drugs for PEP. Alternative antimicrobial drugs that might be used for PEP if first-line agents are not tolerated or are unavailable include levofloxacin and moxifloxacin; amoxicillin and penicillin VK if the isolate is penicillin susceptible; and clindamycin. The antimicrobial drug linezolid cannot be used for extended periods. Also, the risk for development of resistance must be kept in mind if using β-lactam drugs.\nVaccine\nClinical trials in humans have demonstrated evidence of seroconversion after 3 doses of AVA. The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously at diagnosis and 2 and 4 weeks later (\n37\n). AVA is not FDA-approved for PEP and could be made available under an Investigational New Drug protocol or an Emergency Use Authorization in a declared emergency.\nAntimicrobial Treatment for Systemic Disease with Possible Meningitis\nEmpiric treatment for anthrax in which anthrax meningitis is suspected or cannot be ruled out should include ≥3 antimicrobial drugs with activity against\nB. anthracis\n; ≥1 drug should have bactericidal activity, ≥1 should be a protein synthesis inhibitor, and all should have good CNS penetration\n(Technical Appendix\nTable 3). Intravenous combination treatment for systemic anthrax with possible meningitis should be provided for ≥2 weeks or until the patient is clinically stable, whichever is longer. Given the high mortality rate associated with meningitis, some expert panelists favored 3 weeks of treatment for patients in whom meningitis could not be ruled out.\nIntravenous ciprofloxacin is preferred as the primary bactericidal component in the treatment of systemic disease on the basis of efficacy in NHP infection models and recent use for anthrax cases. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are considered equivalent alternatives to ciprofloxacin. The fluoroquinolones have adequate CNS penetration (\n16\n) and there are no reports of natural resistance.\nThe carbapenem class of antimicrobial drugs is highly resistant to β-lactamases and provides good CNS penetration. Meropenem is preferred as the second antimicrobial drug in the combination antimicrobial drug regimen for anthrax meningitis. If meropenem is unavailable, doripenem and imipenem/cilastatin are considered equivalent alternatives. Imipenem/cilastatin is associated with increased seizure risk (\n38\n) and should be used with caution in patients with suspected meningitis. If the\nB. anthracis\nstrain is susceptible to penicillin (MIC <0.125 µg/mL), penicillin G or ampicillin are acceptable alternatives to carbapenems.\nAt least 1 antimicrobial drug that inhibits protein synthesis should be used to reduce exotoxin production. Linezolid is preferred as the first-line protein synthesis inhibitor. It is preferred over clindamycin because it is likely to provide better CNS penetration (\n39\n), although randomized controlled trials on treatment for CNS infections with either agent are lacking. However, linezolid toxicity issues must be taken into consideration. Myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients receiving linezolid (\n40", "n_chars": 4019, "n_tokens_est": 1004, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.839077Z"}

It is preferred over clindamycin because it is likely to provide better CNS penetration (\n39\n), although randomized controlled trials on treatment for CNS infections with either agent are lacking. However, linezolid toxicity issues must be taken into consideration. Myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients receiving linezolid (\n40\n). Linezolid should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing myelosuppression. In patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the benefit of linezolid treatment should be weighed against the risk for serotonin toxicity and an alternative should be considered. If patients experience visual impairment, prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. If patients have contraindications to linezolid use or it is unavailable, clindamycin is an acceptable alternative. Rifampin, although not a protein synthesis inhibitor, has been widely used for its synergistic effect with a primary drug and could also be used in this capacity if linezolid or clindamycin are unavailable. The protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol has good CNS penetration and has historically been used to successfully treat anthrax. Where available, it could be an acceptable alternative if linezolid, clindamycin, and rifampin are unavailable. Doxycycline should not be used if meningitis is suspected because it does not adequately penetrate the CNS.\nAntimicrobial Treatment for Systemic Disease If Meningitis Is Ruled Out\nWith the following 4 exceptions, antimicrobial drug options for patients with systemic anthrax are similar to those for patients with suspected meningitis or when meningitis cannot be ruled out (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 4). First, treatment should include ≥2 antimicrobial drugs with activity against\nB. anthracis\n; ≥1 should have bactericidal activity and ≥1 should be a protein synthesis inhibitor. Second, initial intravenous combination treatment should be given for ≥2 weeks or until the patient is clinically stable, whichever is longer. Third, if the\nB. anthracis\nstrain is susceptible to penicillin, then penicillin G is considered equivalent to the fluoroquinolone options for primary bactericidal treatment. Fourth, treatment with antimicrobial drugs that have good CNS penetration is not a crucial factor. Thus, meropenem is recommended as an acceptable alternative option than as a first-line antimicrobial drug, and vancomycin is also an acceptable alternative. Clindamycin and linezolid are considered equivalent first-line choices for protein synthesis inhibitors. Doxycycline is added as an alternative protein synthesis inhibitor option if linezolid or clindamycin are contraindicated or unavailable.\nFollow–up Oral Treatment for Systemic Disease\nOnce patients with systemic illness who were exposed to aerosolized spores have completed initial combination treatment, they should be transitioned to single-agent oral treatment to prevent relapse from surviving\nB. anthracis\nspores. Antimicrobial drug options are the same as those for PEP (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 2).\nTreatment for Cutaneous Anthrax without Systemic Involvement\nUncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has been successfully treated with a single oral antimicrobial drug (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 5). Oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) and doxycycline are equivalent first-line agents. Clindamycin is an alternative option if fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are contraindicated or unavailable. Given the long history of successful treatment of localized uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax with penicillin, amoxicillin and penicillin VK are also alternative therapeutic options if the isolate is known to be susceptible to penicillin. However, adequate dosages must be used because of the potential for development of drug resistance during treatment with subtherapeutic dosing.\nDuration of treatment for localized or uncomplicated cutaneous disease depends on the\nB. anthracis\nexposure source. If naturally acquired (e.g., animals with anthrax, products such as hides from animals with anthrax), a 7–10-day course of antimicrobial drugs is sufficient. If bioterrorism-related exposure or an aerosol exposure is suspected, the recommendation is the same as that for PEP (\nTechnical Appendix", "n_chars": 4545, "n_tokens_est": 1136, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.839146Z"}

If bioterrorism-related exposure or an aerosol exposure is suspected, the recommendation is the same as that for PEP (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 2) because the patient is likely to have also inhaled spores.\nAntitoxins\nIn case series of patients with cutaneous anthrax who received no treatment during 1890–1907 or antiserum during 1903–1907 (\nTechnical Appendix\nTable 6), 23.7% of the 26,567 untreated patients died. In contrast, 11.8% of the 305 patients who received antiserum died. Although there are far fewer data for patients with inhalation anthrax, in the pre-antibiotic era, there were 3 survivors among 6 patients treated with antiserum (\n26\n).\nThere are currently 2 antitoxins in the CDC Strategic National Stockpile: raxibacumab (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) and Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (AIGIV) (Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Both antitoxins inhibit binding of PA to anthrax toxin receptors and translocation of the 2 primary toxins (LT and ET) into cells. Raxibacumab is a recombinant, fully humanized, IgG1λ monoclonal antibody. AIGIV is a human polyclonal antiserum made from plasma of persons immunized with AVA, which might have some direct effect on LF and EF.\nRaxibacumab\nRaxibacumab increased survival in animal studies when administered as monotherapy: 44% of rabbits treated with 40 mg/kg survived compared with no survivors in the control group (p = 0.003), and 50% and 64% of NHPs treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, survived, compared with no survivors in the control group (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) (\n41\n). When raxibacumab was combined with antimicrobial drugs, 82% of rabbits given raxibacumab plus levofloxacin survived compared with 65% given levofloxacin alone (p = 0.0874).\nRaxibacumab appeared safe and well tolerated in 333 healthy adults who received the recommended dose of 40 mg/kg. Most adverse events were transient and mild to moderate in severity. Pruritis was noted in 2.1% of persons treated with raxibacumab and in none treated with placebo (\n41\n). Although raxibacumab has not been given to patients with systemic anthrax, it is FDA-approved for PEP and treatment for anthrax under the Animal Rule Summary (\nwww.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/.../UCM239734.ppt\n).\nAnthrax Immune Globulin\nIn animal studies, AIGIV increased survival when administered without an antimicrobial drug. Twenty-six percent of rabbits that received 15 U/kg survived, compared with 2% in the control group (p<0.001); 44% of NHPs that received the same dose survived, compared with 6% in the control group (p<0.05). Seventy-one percent of NHPs survived when 30 U/kg of AIGIV was used (p<0.001 compared with placebo). When AIGIV was added to antimicrobial drugs, 70% of rabbits treated with AIGIV plus levofloxacin survived, compared with 25% of control animals treated with intravenous immunoglobulin plus levofloxacin (p = 0.13).\nAIGIV was evaluated in 74 healthy adult volunteers and appears safe and well tolerated at all doses tested. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, pharyngolaryngeal pain, and nausea. A total of 19 patients with anthrax have received AIGIV as an adjunct to antimicrobial drugs: 3 had inhalation anthrax, 15 had injection anthrax, and 1 had gastrointestinal anthrax. All patients appeared to tolerate the antitoxin, and 13 survived: 2 with inhalation anthrax (\n30\n), 10 with injection anthrax (W.A. Bower, unpub. data), and 1 with gastrointestinal anthrax (\n). AIGIV is not FDA approved and could be made available under an Investigational New Drug protocol or an Emergency Use Authorization during a declared emergency.\nAntitoxin Summary", "n_chars": 4123, "n_tokens_est": 1030, "created_at": "2026-01-21T13:08:37.839204Z"}

AIGIV is not FDA approved and could be made available under an Investigational New Drug protocol or an Emergency Use Authorization during a declared emergency.\nAntitoxin Summary\nPre-antimicrobial era observational data for humans and animal studies indicate that anthrax antitoxins are effective when given without and with antimicrobial drugs. However antimicrobial drugs alone can also be effective if given early in the course of disease. During the 2001 outbreak, all 6 patients with inhalation anthrax who received intravenous antimicrobial drugs during the prodromal phase of their illness survived, and all 5 who received antimicrobial drugs after the prodromal phase died (\n15\n). Although anthrax antitoxin has a role in treatment for systemic anthrax, data on the optimal time to initiate it are lacking, and the opinions of expert panelists were mixed on this issue. Given that systemic anthrax has a high case-fatality rate and the risk for antitoxin treatment appears to be low, the potential benefit achieved by adding antitoxin to combination antimicrobial drug treatment outweighs the potential risk. An antitoxin should be added to combination antimicrobial drug treatment for any patient for whom there is a high level of clinical suspicion for systemic anthrax. Although there is some experience with AIGIV use in humans, there are no major medical, operational, or logistical considerations that clearly favor use of 1 antitoxin over another in adults with systemic anthrax.\nConclusions\nBiodefense experts currently place\nB. anthracis\nat or near the top of the list for potential threat agents: it is available and easy to disseminate, and systemic anthrax infection has a high mortality rate. Before 2001, mortality rates for patients with inhalation anthrax approached 90%. Since that time, 8 (53%) of 15 known patients with inhalation anthrax have survived. These survivors were given an early diagnosis, began combination antimicrobial drug treatment to eradicate the bacteria and inhibit toxin production, and had aggressive pleural effusion management. The principles of prevention and clinical care provided in this report are based on currently available data and the lessons learned from recent anthrax events.\nThere are many opportunities for improving prevention of and treatment for anthrax. Some evidence suggests the duration of PEP antimicrobial drug use could be decreased when given in conjunction with AVA. Further research could provide sufficient evidence to decrease the length of the antimicrobial drug component of PEP. Efforts are ongoing to develop point-of-care assays. Assays that quantify toxin levels or antibody response could enable earlier diagnosis and treatment and help identify optimal timing for antitoxin administration. Pharmacokinetic data for antimicrobial drugs used to treat anthrax are limited and almost no pharmacokinetic data for CNS are available, but such data are needed for dosing recommendations. Animal studies are needed to evaluate synergistic or antagonistic activity in multiple antimicrobial drug combinations; to study the survival effect of corticosteroids or other adjunctive treatments for meningitis, edema, and vasopressor-resistant shock; and to determine whether currently recommended antitoxin dosing is optimal. Currently available antitoxins counteract extracellular toxins. Studies are needed to assess whether intracellular toxin inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved for other indications, are efficacious in animal models of anthrax infection. Such agents might be of use in patients in the fulminant phase of disease. When research needed to change the anthrax mortality rate is conducted,\nB. anthracis\nwill become a less competent, and therefore less desirable, bioweapon.\nDr Hendricks is a medical officer in the Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.

(\nView PDF\nView Summary Chart\n) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Endorsed December 2024)\nSummary\nThe 2024 U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (U.S. MEC) comprises recommendations for the use of specific contraceptive methods by persons who have certain characteristics or medical conditions. These recommendations for health care providers were updated by CDC after review of the scientific evidence and a meeting with national experts in Atlanta, Georgia, during January 25–27, 2023. The information in this report replaces the 2016 U.S. MEC (CDC. U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016. MMWR 2016:65[No. RR-3]:1–103). Notable updates include 1) the addition of recommendations for persons with chronic kidney disease; 2) revisions to the recommendations for persons with certain characteristics or medical conditions (i.e., breastfeeding, postpartum, postabortion, obesity, surgery, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with or without anticoagulant therapy, thrombophilia, superficial venous thrombosis, valvular heart disease, peripartum cardiomyopathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, high risk for HIV infection, cirrhosis, liver tumor, sickle cell disease, solid organ transplantation, and drug interactions with antiretrovirals used for prevention or treatment of HIV infection); and 3) inclusion of new contraceptive methods, including new doses or formulations of combined oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, vaginal rings, progestin-only pills, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, and vaginal pH modulator. The recommendations in this report are intended to serve as a source of evidence-based clinical practice guidance for health care providers. The goals of these recommendations are to remove unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception and to support the provision of person-centered contraceptive counseling and services in a noncoercive manner. Health care providers should always consider the individual clinical circumstances of each person seeking contraceptive services. This report is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice for individual patients; when needed, patients should seek advice from their health care providers about contraceptive use.\nU.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2024\n.

(\nView PDF\n) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Endorsed December 2024)\nSummary\nThe 2024 U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (U.S. SPR) addresses a selected group of common, yet sometimes complex, issues regarding initiation and use of specific contraceptive methods. These recommendations for health care providers were updated by CDC after review of the scientific evidence and a meeting with national experts in Atlanta, Georgia, during January 25–27, 2023. The information in this report replaces the 2016 U.S. SPR (CDC. U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2016. MMWR 2016;65[No. RR-4]:1–66). Notable updates include 1) updated recommendations for provision of medications for intrauterine device placement, 2) updated recommendations for bleeding irregularities during implant use, 3) new recommendations for testosterone use and risk for pregnancy, and 4) new recommendations for self-administration of injectable contraception. The recommendations in this report are intended to serve as a source of evidence based clinical practice guidance for health care providers. The goals of these recommendations are to remove unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception and to support the provision of person-centered contraceptive counseling and services in a noncoercive manner. Health care providers should always consider the individual clinical circumstances of each person seeking contraceptive services. This report is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice for individual patients; when needed, patients should seek advice from their health care providers about contraceptive use.\nRecommended Adult Immunization Schedule for Ages 19 Years or Older, United States, 2025.* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nView PDF\n(Endorsed November 2024)\n*ACOG endorses the CDC's Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule for Ages 19 Years or Older, published and originally endorsed in 2024 and posted here, including the recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
